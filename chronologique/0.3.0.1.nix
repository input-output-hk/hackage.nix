Since machine clock cycles are in units of\nnanoseconds, this has the nice property that, assuming the system clock is not\ncorrupted, two subsequent events from the same source process are likely to\nhave monotonically increasing timestamps. And even if the system clock has\nskew, they're still decently likely to be unique per device. These TimeStamps\nthus make good keys when building Maps.\n\nThe core type is in \"Chrono.TimeStamp\", see there for full documentation.";
