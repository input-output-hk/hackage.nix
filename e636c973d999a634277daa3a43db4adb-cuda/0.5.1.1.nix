You will need to install the CUDA driver and\ndeveloper toolkit.\n\n<http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>\n\nThe configure script will look for your CUDA installation in the standard\nplaces, and if the nvcc compiler is found in your PATH, relative to that.\n\n/NOTE:/ Mavericks users (OS X 10.9) should use CUDA 5.5.28 and upwards.\n\nThis release is for version 5.0 of the CUDA toolkit.";
