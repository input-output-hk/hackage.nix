They also can be combined quite nicely,\n\n@\ntype NewConstraint a = (Constraint1 a, Constraint2 a)\n@\n\nhowever you always need to start with a plain old type class when building constraints.\n\nThis library provides a type class that is not really a constraint at all, so you can \"start from zero\" with building up a custom constraint.\nAlso its opposite (a constraint that no type can ever fulfill).";
