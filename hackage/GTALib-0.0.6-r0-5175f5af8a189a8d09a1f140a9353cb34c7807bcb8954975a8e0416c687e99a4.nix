      description = "This package provides the core functionalities of the GTA (Generate, Test, and Aggregate) programming framework on Haskell (c.f., Kento Emoto, Sebastian Fischer, Zhenjiang Hu: Generate, Test, and Aggregate - A Calculation-based Framework for Systematic Parallel Programming with MapReduce. ESOP 2012: 254-273. The authors' version is available at <http://www.ipl-lab.org/~emoto/ESOP2012.pdf>).\n\n/Example/\n\nThe following code is a GTA program to solve the 0-1 Knapsack problem (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem>). It /appears to be an exponential cost/ proram in the number of input items, because it appears to generate all item selections by @subsP items@ (/Generate/), discard those with total weight heavier than the knapsack's capacity by @`filterBy` weightlimit capacity@ (/Test/), and take the most valuable selection by @`aggregateBy` maxsumsolutionWith getValue@ (/Aggregate/). However, it /actually runs in a linear time/ owing to our proposed program transformation 'Filter-embedding Semiring Fusion' implemented in the library. In addition, it runs in /parallel/ so that you can get linear speedup.\n\n> knapsack capacity items =\n>  subsP items\n>  `filterBy` weightlimit capacity\n>  `aggregateBy` maxsumsolutionWith getValue\n>\n> getValue (_, v) = v\n> getWeight (w, _) = w\n>\n> weightlimit w = (<=w) <.> weightsum where\n>   weightsum = homJ' times single nil\n>   x1 `times` x2  = (   x1 +    x2) `min` (w+1)\n>   single i  = getWeight i `min` (w+1)\n>   nil = 0\n\nSeveral examples of GTA programming are found in /examples/ directory at <https://bitbucket.org/emoto/gtalib/src>.";
