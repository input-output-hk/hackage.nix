This package provides an interface to that system call.\nIt also used to expose an STM interface for running @select(2)@ with alternative STM actions,\nbut that functionality was split into the stm-orelse-io package from version 0.3.\n\nChanges in version 0.3:\n\n* Split all STM-related functionality into a separate package, stm-orelse-io, independent\nof select.\n\nTODO:\n\n* Provide a type for @fd_set@ that can be passed to and from C so that we can have a version\nof 'System.Posix.IO.select' that reports /which/ file descriptors are ready, instead of how many.\nIts type will be something like @[Fd] -> [Fd] -> [Fd] -> Timeout -> IO ([Fd], [Fd], [Fd])@.\n\n/NOTE/: I feel I'm occupying prime namespace realestate with a package name\nlike select. I'll happily let myself be chased away if anybody else wants\nto use this package name. Let me know.";
