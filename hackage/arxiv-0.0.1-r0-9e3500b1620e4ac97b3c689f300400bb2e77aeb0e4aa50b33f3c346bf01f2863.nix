In many fields of mathematics and physics,\nalmost all scientific papers are self-archived on the arXiv.\n\nThe arXiv features an API to ease access to e-prints.\nThis library provides a simple and easy-to-use Haskell binding\nfor the arXiv API.\n\nFor the full documentation of the arXiv API, please refer to\n<http://arxiv.org/help/api/index>.\n\nMore information on this haskell library,\nexamples and a test suite are available\non <https://github.com/toschoo/Haskell-Libs>.";
