This makes it\npossible to print messages and prompts that include terminal escape\nsequences such as colors that are automatically disabled when\nstandard input is a file.  It also means that Byline works on both\nPOSIX-compatible systems and on Windows.\n\nThe primary features of Byline include printing messages, prompting\nfor input, and generating custom menus.  It was inspired by the\n@highline@ Ruby library and the @terminal@ library by Craig Roche.";
