Variables are interpolated according to their type through a typeclass.\n\nShakespeare templates can be used inline with a quasi-quoter or in an external file.\n\nNote there is no dependency on haskell-src-extras. Instead Shakespeare believes logic should stay out of templates and has its own minimal Haskell parser.\n\nPackages that use this: shakespeare-js, shakespeare-css, shakespeare-text, hamlet, and xml-hamlet\n\nPlease see the documentation at <http://www.yesodweb.com/book/shakespearean-templates> for more details.";
