      description = "ENet is a networking library on top of UDP. In it's own words:\n\n\"ENet's purpose is to provide a relatively thin, simple and robust network\ncommunication layer on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol). The primary\nfeature it provides is optional reliable, in-order delivery of packets.\n\nENet omits certain higher level networking features such as authentication,\nlobbying, server discovery, encryption, or other similar tasks that are\nparticularly application specific so that the library remains flexible,\nportable, and easily embeddable.\"\n\nThis library contains both bindings and a slightly cleaned up interface on\ntop. The bindings are as close to the original as possible. Names are striped\nof the leading 'enet_' and converted to CamelCase, and the occasional newtype\nis used instead, but otherwise all functions signatures are exactly the\nsame. The bindings are in 'Network.ENet.Bindings'.\n\nThe higher level interface is all other exposed modules. Functions like\n'enet_host_*' are placed in 'Network.ENet.Host'. All functions are present\nexcept for the 'enet_socket*' functions: they are just wrappers of the Posix\nSockets Interface, which is already provided in Haskell by the 'network'\npackage. Changes are fairly minimal: \"Out-Args\" are now returned with a tuple,\nconversions between C and Haskell types happen automatically (when Haskell\nversions exists), and nullable pointer types have been replaced with\nMaybes. In short, there should be very few reasons to use the raw bindings\nover the \"nice\" interface.\n\nAt the moment, consult the ENet website for documentation. In the vast\nmajority of cases the documentation there should apply here exactly, I will\ntry to add Haddock documentation for everywhere it does not.\n\nENet currently only supports IPv4 at the moment (though that should soon\nchange), and must be called from only one bound thread (i.e. thread created\nwith 'forkOS'). Richer native networking libraries leveraging Haskell's\nstrengths exist, and for new projects I'd recommend those. But for interfacing\nwith existing protocols using ENet, this package should be quite useful.";
