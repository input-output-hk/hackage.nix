      description = "This library processes arrays like @Repa@ and @Accelerate@,\nbut it uses the just-in-time compiler of @LLVM@\nfor generating the machine code.\nThat is, you get very efficient vectorised code\nthat can be run without a GPU.\nYou do not need to care about inlining and strictness annotations,\nbecause the LLVM code is by default inlined and strict.\nThe package is the basis for an LLVM backend for the @Accelerate@ framework.\n\nHighlights:\n\n* Very flexible index handling,\neven more flexible than the one of 'Data.Array'.\nIt is much more expressive and type-safe than that of @repa@ and @array@.\n\n* Extensible element types, e.g. complex numbers.\n(Maybe this is also possible with accelerate, e.g. with RGB type.)\n\n* Every compilable program also runs.\nIn contrast to that, @accelerate@ may accept a program\nthat cannot be run by a particular backend, like @accelerate-cuda@.\n\nKnown deficiencies:\n\n* The functions do not check array bounds.\n(Of course, we can think about temporary bound checking\nfor debugging purposes.)\n\n* The package does not try to distribute work across multiple processors.\nIt is certainly simpler, more efficient and more reliable\nif you do that at a higher level.\n\nThe name of the package is inspired by the visualization of typical operations\nlike reshaping, collapsing a dimension and extruding another one.";
