In contrast to the standard NVPTX target\nbuilt in to the LLVM toolchain, NVVM includes a set of proprietary\noptimisations which are otherwise only available by compiling CUDA code with\nthe `nvcc` compiler.\n\nThe resulting PTX code can be loaded onto the GPU and executed using the\n'cuda' package:\n\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cuda>\n\nThe NVVM library is a compiler component available a part of the CUDA toolkit:\n\n<https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit>\n\nThe configure step will look for your CUDA installation in the standard\nplaces, and if the `nvcc` compiler is found in your `PATH`, relative to that.\n\nThis package tested with version 7.5 of the CUDA toolkit.\n";
