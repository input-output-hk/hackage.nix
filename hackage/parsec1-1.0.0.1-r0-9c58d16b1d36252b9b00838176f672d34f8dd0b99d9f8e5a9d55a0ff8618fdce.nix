It is simple, safe, well documented (on the package\nhomepage), has extensive libraries and good error messages,\nand is also fast.\n\nThis package is the core haskell98 part of the parsec2\npackage, intended to preserve its simplicity and portability.\n\nNote, that the module names overlap with those of parsec from the Haskell\nPlatform, therefore I do not recommend to unconditionally use parsec1 (or\nparsec2 and parsec3) as dependency instead of \"parsec < 3\", \"parsec > 2\", or\njust \"parsec\".  In order to ensure the use of these limited and portable\nparsec1 functions, you may want to hide the official parsec package for\nyour own developments.\n\nThis version only differs from the pervious one by a changed description.";
