      description = "'syntax' allows you to write a single syntax description and instantiate is both as a parser and a pretty printer.\n\nThe interface is based on a custom Functor\\/Applicative\\/Monad hierarchy, provided by the 'semi-iso' package. You fmap using\na semi-isomorphism instead of function. A semi-isomorphism is a isomorphism that can fail in both directions, with slightly\nweakened laws. It is worth to note that @Iso@s and @Prism@s from 'lens' are valid semi-isomorphisms :)\n\nOnce you write a description you can, for example turn it into an Attoparsec parser, or into a 'Data.Syntax.Printer.Text.Printer'.\n\nSee @syntax-example@ and @syntax-example-json@ for examples, @syntax-attoparsec@ and @syntax-printer@ for a parser/printer implementation.\n\nThe library was inspired by:\n\n* Rendel, Tillmann, and Klaus Ostermann. \"Invertible syntax descriptions: unifying parsing and pretty printing.\" ACM Sigplan Notices. Vol. 45. No. 11. ACM, 2010.\n\nTODO:\n\n* Research relative monads and relative monad transformers. Indent is basically a Reader monad over a syntax. How would a State monad look?\n\n* Try to implement Haskell layout rule.\n\n* Combinators for binary data formats, vectors.\n\n* Better error messages.\n\n* Maybe an implementation of do notation for SemiIsoMonad with QuasiQuoters, like the codo notation for comonads.";
