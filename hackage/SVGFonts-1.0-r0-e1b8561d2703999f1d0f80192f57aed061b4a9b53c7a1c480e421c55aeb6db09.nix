Foreground and background color can be freely chosen.\n\n* Everything is stored in a simple SceneGraph: <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/collada-types>\n\n* Complete implementation of the features that fontforge produces (but not the complete SVG format):\n\n* Kerning (i.e. the two characters in \\\"VA\\\" have a shorter distance than in \\\"VV\\\")\n\n* Unicode, Ligatures\n\nXML speed issues can be solved by trimming the svg file to only those characters that are used (or maybe binary xml one day)\n";
