Kent Dybvig, Simon Peyton Jones, and Amr Sabry\nJFP, v17, N6, pp. 687--730, 2007.\n<http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/techreports/TRNNN.cgi?trnum=TR615>\n\nThis library's \"Control.Monad.CC.CCCxe\" is derived as a CPS version of\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/CC-delcont-exc>'s Control.Monad.CC.CCExc.\n\"Control.Monad.CC.CCCxe\" is sometimes more efficient; it is always less perspicuous.\nBoth libraries provide the identical interface and are interchangeable. It seems\nthat CC-delcont-exc's  Control.Monad.CC.CCExc is faster at delimited control but\nimposes more overhead on the conventional code; \"Control.Monad.CC.CCCxe\" is dual.\nIt pays to use \"Control.Monad.CC.CCCxe\" in code with long stretches of determinism\npunctuated by fits and restarts.\n\nSee the original article at <http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/implementations.html#CC-monads>\nfor more information.\n\nThis package split multi-prompt delimited control from\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/liboleg> for usability.";
