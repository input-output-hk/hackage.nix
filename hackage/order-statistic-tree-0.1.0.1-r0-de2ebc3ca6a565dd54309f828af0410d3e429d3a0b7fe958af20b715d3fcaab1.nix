      description = "This repository contains an implementation of order statistic tree in Haskell programming language.\nI could not find an order statistic tree at Hackage, so I have to develop one.\n\nThis implementation uses weight-balanced trees which are desribed in\n\n- Hirai, Yoichi, and Kazuhiko Yamamoto. \"Balancing weight-balanced trees.\" Journal of Functional Programming 21.03 (2011): 287-307.\n\nAlso some code is based on containers package.\n\nImplementation of order statistic tree is described in\n\n- Cormen, T.H., Leiserson, Rivest, Stein. Introduction to algorithms. The MIT Press. 3rd ed.\n\n= Benchmarks\n\nI tried to make this tree as fast as possible. The results on my i7-4790 with 16Gb RAM are following:\n\n- OSTree was created from 1.000.000 random numbers in 2.087 ± 0.021 s (e.g. for Data.Map.Strict - 1.977 ± 0.016 s);\n- deletion from OSTree with 1.000.000 random numbers was made in 13.94 ± 0.93 ms;\n- lookup from OSTree with 1.000.000 random numbers was made in 208.2 ± 3.48 ns;\n- selection from OSTree with 1.000.000 random numbers was made in 92.72 ± 1.91 ns;\n- full testing protocol can be found in result-bench.txt.";
