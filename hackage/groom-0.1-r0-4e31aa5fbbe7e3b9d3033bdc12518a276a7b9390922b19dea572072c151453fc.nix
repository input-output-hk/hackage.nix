However, for large\ndata-structures, the resulting output lacks\nwhitespace, making it unreadable.  Groom offers an\nreplacement to `show' called `groom' which attempts\nto pretty-print the output of `show'.  For example:\n\n> let x = parseExp \"foobar 1 [1,2]\"\n> in do\n>   putStrLn (show x)\n>   putStrLn (groom x)\n\nresults in:\n\n> ParseOk (App (App (Var (UnQual (Ident \"foobar\"))) (Lit (Int 1))) (List [Lit (Int 1),Lit (Int 2)]))\n> ParseOk\n>   (App (App (Var (UnQual (Ident \"foobar\"))) (Lit (Int 1)))\n>      (List [Lit (Int 1), Lit (Int 2)]))\n\nGroom works only on Show instances that output valid\nHaskell code; if Groom can't understand its input,\nit will not make any changes.";
