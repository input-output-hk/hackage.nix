      description = "This package provides Haskell bindings for\n<https://github.com/jgm/cmark libcmark>, the reference\nparser for <http://commonmark.org CommonMark>, a fully\nspecified variant of Markdown. It includes sources for\nlibcmark (0.19.0) and does not require prior installation of the\nC library.\n\ncmark provides the following advantages over existing\nMarkdown libraries for Haskell:\n\n-   Speed: Conversion speed is on par with the\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sundown sundown>\nlibrary. We were unable to measure precisely\nagainst\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sundown sundown>,\nwhich raised a malloc error when compiled into our\nbenchmark suite. Relative to other implementations:\ncmark was 82 times faster than\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cheapskate cheapskate>,\n59 times faster than\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/markdown markdown>,\n105 times faster than\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc pandoc>,\nand 2.8 times faster than\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/discount discount>.\n\n-   Memory footprint: Memory footprint is on par with\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sundown sundown>.\nOn one sample, the library uses a fourth the memory that\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/markdown markdown>\nuses, and less than a tenth the memory that\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc pandoc>\nuses.\n\n-   Robustness: cmark can handle whatever is thrown\nat it, without the exponential blowups in parsing\ntime one can sometimes get with other libraries.\n(The input @bench\\/full-sample.md@, for example,\ncauses both\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc pandoc>\nand\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/markdown markdown>\nto grind to a halt.)\n\n-   Accuracy: cmark passes the CommonMark spec\\'s\nsuite of over 500 conformance tests.\n\n-   Standardization: Since there is a spec and a\ncomprehensive suite of tests, we can have a high\ndegree of confidence that any two CommonMark\nimplementations will behave the same. Thus, for\nexample, one could use this library for server-side\nrendering and\n<http://github.com/jgm/commonmark.js commonmark.js>\nfor client-side previewing.\n\n-   Ease of installation: cmark is portable and has\nminimal dependencies.\n\ncmark does not provide Haskell versions of the whole\n<http://github.com/jgm/cmark libcmark> API, which is\nbuilt around mutable @cmark_node@ objects. Instead, it\nprovides functions for converting CommonMark to HTML\n(and other formats), and a function for converting\nCommonMark to a @Node@ tree that can be processed\nfurther using Haskell.\n\nA note on security: This library does not attempt\nto sanitize HTML output. We recommend using\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xss-sanitize xss-sanitize>\nto filter the output.\n\nA note on stability: There is a good chance the API\nwill change significantly after this early release.";
