      description = "This package defines the type class @MonadBaseControl@, a subset of\n@MonadBase@ into which generic control operations such as @catch@ can be\nlifted from @IO@ or any other base monad. Instances are based on monad\ntransformers in @MonadTransControl@, which includes all standard monad\ntransformers in the @transformers@ library except @ContT@.\n\nSee the @lifted-base@ package which uses @monad-control@ to lift @IO@\noperations from the @base@ library (like @catch@ or @bracket@) into any monad\nthat is an instance of @MonadBase@ or @MonadBaseControl@.\n\nNote that this package is a rewrite of Anders Kaseorg's @monad-peel@\nlibrary. The main difference is that this package provides CPS style operators\nand exploits the @RankNTypes@ and @TypeFamilies@ language extensions to\nsimplify and speedup most definitions.\n\nThe following @criterion@ based benchmark shows that @monad-control@ is on\naverage about 99% faster than @monad-peel@:\n\n@git clone <https://github.com/basvandijk/bench-monad-peel-control>@";
