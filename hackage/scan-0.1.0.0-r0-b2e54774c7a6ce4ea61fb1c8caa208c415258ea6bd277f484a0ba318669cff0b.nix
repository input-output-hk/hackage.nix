It reports\n(and partly repairs if given the @-@ option):\nnon-ascii characters,\ntabs or carriage returns,\ntrailing white spaces,\nbackslash at line end,\nunconventional comment delimiters,\ntoo long lines,\ntoo many consecutive blank lines,\nnot a single blank between tokens,\nnot a single final newline,\nno spaces after commas,\nspaces between parens and infix operators in sections,\nbad layout (wrt @do@ or @of@).\nIt may be useful in conjunction with\n<http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/hlint/>\nto give suggestions on how to improve your source code.\nRepairing is not suited for slices (aka @\$(...)@) in template haskell or if\nyou like to align your code at @=@ or @->@ in the middle of a line (thus\nwanting multiple blanks). Furthermore layout may be destroyed by inserting\nor deleting blanks, but this is an indication for improving layout anyway.\nAlso lines may become too long after inserting blanks.";
