The loader just about\ndoes the job but error handling is a bit crap\nat the moment.\nComes with a HUnit test suite which you can run using the HsSqlPppTests\nexecutable, and command line access to some functions via a exe called\nHsSqlSystem. See the project page <https://launchpad.net/hssqlppp>\nfor more information and documentation links.";
