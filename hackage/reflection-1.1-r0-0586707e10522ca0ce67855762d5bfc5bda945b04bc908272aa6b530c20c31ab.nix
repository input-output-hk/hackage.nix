However, the API has been streamlined to improve performance.\n\nThe original paper can be obtained from <http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/prepose/prepose.pdf>\n\n/Changes from 0.5 to 1.1/:\n\n* Much faster implementation available that is about 50 /times/ faster than 0.9 and which runs\npurely on black magic. This version is now used by default. To turn it off install with the\n'slow' flag. If you encounter a problem with implementation, please contact the author.\n\n* Removed @ReifiedNum@, @reflectNum@, and @reifyIntegral@; @reify@ and @reflect@ are\nabout 3 orders of magnitude faster than the special case combinators were.\n\n/Changes in 0.5/:\n\n* Generalized the type signatures in reflect to allow you to pass any type\nwith kind @* -> *@ wrapped around the desired type as the phantom type\nargument rather than just a @Proxy@.\n\n/Changes in 0.4/:\n\n* Converted from `Data.Tagged` to using `Data.Proxy` for reflection. This\nreduces the need for helper functions and scoped type variables in user\ncode.";
