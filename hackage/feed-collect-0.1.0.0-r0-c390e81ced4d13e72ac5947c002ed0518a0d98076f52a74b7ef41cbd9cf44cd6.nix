Client programs do a variety of things with them:\nDisplay feed items for a human user to read, send them into IRC, convert them\nto e-mail messages, aggregate them into larger feeds (\"planet\"s) and so on.\n\nThis package tries to provide a generic API for handling a stream of news\nitems, not tied to any specific use case.\n\nUsing the library you can launch a thread which collects news items, and\nhandles them using a custom action you provide. Expected usage in many cases\nis to push items (or specific parts of them) into a 'Chan', and have your\napplication's event loop thread do the actual logic.\n\nSome related packages which make specific uses of feeds are @imm@ and\n@rss2irc@. These 2 packages have inspired some ideas here.";
