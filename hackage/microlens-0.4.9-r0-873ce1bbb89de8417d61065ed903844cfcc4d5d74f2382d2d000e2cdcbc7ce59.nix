It's not a toy lenses library, unsuitable for “real world”, but merely a small one. It is compatible with lens, and should have same performance. It also has better documentation.\n\nThere's a longer readme <https://github.com/aelve/microlens#readme on Github>. It has a migration guide for lens users, a description of other packages in the family, a discussion of other lens libraries you could use instead, and so on.\n\nHere are some usecases for this library:\n\n* You want to define lenses or traversals in your own library, but don't want to depend on lens. Having lenses available often make working with a library more pleasant.\n\n* You just want to be able to use lenses to transform data (or even just use @over _1@ to change the first element of a tuple).\n\n* You are new to lenses and want a small library to play with.\n\nHowever, don't use this library if:\n\n* You need @Iso@s, @Prism@s, indexed traversals, or actually anything else which isn't defined here (tho some indexed functions are available elsewhere – containers and vector provide them for their types, and <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ilist ilist> provides indexed functions for lists).\n\n* You want a library with a clean, understandable implementation (in which case you're looking for <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-simple lens-simple>).\n\nAs already mentioned, if you're writing an application which uses lenses more extensively, look at <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-platform microlens-platform> – it combines features of most other microlens packages (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-mtl microlens-mtl>, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-th microlens-th>, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-ghc microlens-ghc>).\n\nIf you want to export getters or folds and don't mind the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/contravariant contravariant> dependency, please consider using <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-contra microlens-contra>.\n\nIf you haven't ever used lenses before, read <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-tutorial/docs/Control-Lens-Tutorial.html this tutorial>. (It's for lens, but it applies to microlens just as well.)\n\nNote that microlens has no dependencies starting from GHC 7.10 (base-4.8). Prior to that, it depends on transformers-0.2 or above.";
