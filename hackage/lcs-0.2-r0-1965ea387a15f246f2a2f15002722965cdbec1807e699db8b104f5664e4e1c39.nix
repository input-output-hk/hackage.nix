For example, lcs \"abcd\" \"acbd\" is either \"abd\" or\n\"acd\".\n\nThe package provides a simple, stupid and (most of all) slow\nimplementation that needs, for inputs of length m and n, O(m+n)\nspace and O((m+n)!) time in the worst case.\n\nIt also provides an implementation of the Hunt-Szymanski LCS\nalgorithm, based on that in \"String searching algorithms\" by\nGraham A Stephen, ISBN 981021829X.\n\nGiven inputs xs and ys of length m and n respectively, where there\nare r pairs (x, y) where x is in xs, y is in ys and x == y,\nHunt-Szymanski needs O(r+m+n) space and O((r+m+n)*log(m+n)) time.\nThus this is O((m+n)^2) space and O((m+n)^2*log(m+n)) time in the\nworst case.";
