The shortest rules may be\npartially ordered by implication (entailment) and equivalence\n(equality) and the top level is also shown in .csv format.\nOptionally all logical entailments and equalities are listed\nas well. If the data set contains ambiguous rules or more\noccurrences of the same rule the user is warned.";
