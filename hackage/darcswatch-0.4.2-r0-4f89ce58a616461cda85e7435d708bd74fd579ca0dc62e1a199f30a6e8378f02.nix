It allows both submitters\nand project maintainers to get an overview of patches that\nhave been submitted but not yet applied. Some notable features are:\n\n* Reads both darcs1 and darcs2.0 (hashed) format repositories.\n\n* Displays patch summaries per user and per repository.\n\n* Patch diff can be reviewed directly.\n\n* Download link for each patch, to apply without searching for the email.\n\n* Knows about inverse and amend-recorded patches and uses them to consider\n\n* Integrates into http://bugs.darcs.net/\n\n* Optionally sends out mails to mailing lists when a patch is applied to a repository\npatches obsolete.";
