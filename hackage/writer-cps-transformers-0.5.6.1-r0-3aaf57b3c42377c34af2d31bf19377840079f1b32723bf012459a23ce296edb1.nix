The WriterT and RWST monad transformers provided by writer-cps-transformers are written in continuation passing style and avoid the space-leak problem of the traditional Control.Monad.Trans.Writer.Strict and Control.Monad.Trans.Writer.Lazy. The corresponding MTL class instances are in the package writer-cps-mtl (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/writer-cps-mtl>).";
