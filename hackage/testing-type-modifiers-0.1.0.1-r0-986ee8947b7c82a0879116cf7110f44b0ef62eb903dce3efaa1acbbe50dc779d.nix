For example a property on non-empty lists:\n\n@  prop_tail_length (NonEmpty xs) = length (tail xs) == length xs - 1 @\n\nThis library is intended to supply these modifiers to be used by testing libraries, in an effort to make\nproperties more portable between testing frameworks.\n\nFor every modifier it also provides an access function that converts to the underlying type, which\nenables point-free style properties as such:\n\n@\nprop_tail_length2 = (> 0) . length . nonEmpty\n@";
