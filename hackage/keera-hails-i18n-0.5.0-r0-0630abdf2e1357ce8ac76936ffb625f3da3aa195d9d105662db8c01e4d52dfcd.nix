It includes two modules: one\nto translate strings in your program, and one to load the settings from your\nconfiguration in your application to let users select the language.\n\nAs an application developer, the expectation is that you would offer a way\nfor users to change the language in their preferences, and that that language\nselection would be stored in a configuration file named \"default-language\".";
