KnownNat n => Proxy n -> Integer\nf _ = natVal (Proxy :: Proxy n) + natVal (Proxy :: Proxy (n+2))\n@\n\nThe plugin can derive @KnownNat@ constraints for types consisting of:\n\n* Type variables, when there is a corresponding @KnownNat@ constraint\n\n* Type-level naturals\n\n* Applications of the arithmetic expression: +,-,*,^\n\n* Type functions, when there is either:\n\n1. a matching given @KnownNat@ constraint; or\n\n2. a corresponding @KnownNat\\<N\\>@ instance for the type function\n\nTo use the plugin, add the\n\n@\nOPTIONS_GHC -fplugin GHC.TypeLits.KnownNat.Solver\n@\n\nPragma to the header of your file.";
