The settings tree structure\ndefinition is separate from the actual setting values, so your program logic\ncode doesn't need to be changed. It can access the settings as regular\nHaskell values.\n\nThe settings are presented to the user as a tree hierarchy. The idea has some\nsimilarity to @git config@ and <http://weechat.org Weechat>'s settings\nsystem, but isn't identical.\n\nNOTE: The API is probably not documented well enough. Sorry for that. I'm\nreleasing like this because I want to release packages which depend on this\nlibrary. Full docs will be written.";
