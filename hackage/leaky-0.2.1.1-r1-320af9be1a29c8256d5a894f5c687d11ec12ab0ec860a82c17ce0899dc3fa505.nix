If you examine the log it's clear that the problem is theirs, and nothing to do with this package or its dependencies. It's a shame this is so prominently displayed and impossible to remedy, it makes unbroken packages seem broken to visitors, and it exerts negative pressure on the use of cpphs (since one can make this rogue report go away by pretending cpphs never existed and depending on the ubiquity of a system-wide cpp)./";
