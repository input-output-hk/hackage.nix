It's not tailored toward any particular\nlanguage, and is not meant to replace tools which target a specific\nenvironment.\n\nPortability is striven towards in two ways:\n- You don't have to deal with the idiosyncrasies of many make implementations\n(well, people don't, but they call their GNU Make files makefiles\ninstead of GNUmakefiles, which causes misunderstandings).\n- You have Haskell at your disposal, and are encouraged to use that\nwhenever possible instead of system-specific binaries like the POSIX\ncommands we all know and love.\n\nWith support for:\n- Parallel task performing.\n- Advanced out-of-dateness detection:\n- Choice between timestamps and hashes.\n- Keeping track of what arguments have been passed.\n- Haskell!";
