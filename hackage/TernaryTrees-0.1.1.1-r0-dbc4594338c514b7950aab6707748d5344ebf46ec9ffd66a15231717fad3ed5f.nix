      description = "Ternary trees are an efficient structure often used for storing\nstrings for fast lookups. This package implements a generic tree\nfor storing lists of Ord instances, and a specialised String\nimplementation which is about 30% faster than the generic version.\n\nAn example program is provided what shows how to use the package\nas a dictionary program for spell checking, and how it can be\nused to serialise data with Don Stewart's Data.Binary package.\n\nFrom my testing, using the \\/usr\\/share\\/dict\\/words file on my system\n(over 230,000 words), inserting all words, checking they all exist\nin the tree, writing them to a binary file, reading them back in\nand checking the read in result is the same as the original takes\nslightly over 3 seconds using the StringSet. The written file is\nalso slightly smaller than the input (by over 40% in some cases).\n\nNew in this version:\n\n* Refactored a lot of the datatypes for the Sets (much of their code is\nexactly the same now)\n\n* Made the get implementation shorter and clearer (thanks to olsner on IRC)\n\n* There is now a darcs repo: <http://random.axman6.com/darcs/TernaryTrees/>\n\n&#169; 2009 by Alex Mason (<http://random.axman6.com/blog/>).
