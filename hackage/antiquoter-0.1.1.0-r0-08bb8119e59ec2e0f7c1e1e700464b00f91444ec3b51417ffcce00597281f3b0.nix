Other antiquoting related features could be\nincluded in the future.\n\nThe modules are\n\n* \"Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.Base\" basic types for building\nantiquoters. It also contains the most detailed example of\nthe basic usage.\n\n* \"Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.ExpPat\" making antiquoters which\ncan antiquote both expressions and patters. Therefore only\none antiquoter has to be defined in stead of two.\n\n* \"Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.Combinators\" more useful\ncombinators to use with the functions from\n\"Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.ExpPat\".";
