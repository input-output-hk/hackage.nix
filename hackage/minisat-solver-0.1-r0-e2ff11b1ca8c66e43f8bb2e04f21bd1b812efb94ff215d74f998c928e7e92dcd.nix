      description = "This package provides high-level Haskell bindings for the well-known\nMiniSat satisfiability solver. It solves the boolean satisfiability\nproblem, i.e., the input is a boolean formula, and the output is a\nlist of all satisfying assignments.\nMiniSat is a fully automated, well-optimized general-purpose SAT\nsolver written by Niklas Een and Niklas Sorensson, and further\nmodified by Takahisa Toda.\nUnlike other similar Haskell packages, we provide a convenient\nhigh-level interface to the SAT solver, hiding the complexity of the\nunderlying C implementation. It can be easily integrated into other\nprograms as an efficient turn-key solution to many search problems.\nTo illustrate the use of the library, two example programs are\nincluded in the \"examples\" directory; one program solves Sudoku\npuzzles, and the other solves a 3-dimensional block packing\nproblem. These programs can be built manually, or by invoking Cabal\nwith the '--enable-benchmarks' option.";
