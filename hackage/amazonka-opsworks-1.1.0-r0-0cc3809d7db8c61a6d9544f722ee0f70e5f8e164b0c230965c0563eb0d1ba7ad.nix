      description = "AWS OpsWorks\nWelcome to the /AWS OpsWorks API Reference/. This guide provides\ndescriptions, syntax, and usage examples about AWS OpsWorks actions and\ndata types, including common parameters and error codes.\nAWS OpsWorks is an application management service that provides an\nintegrated experience for overseeing the complete application lifecycle.\nFor information about this product, go to the\n<http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/ AWS OpsWorks> details page.\n__SDKs and CLI__\nThe most common way to use the AWS OpsWorks API is by using the AWS\nCommand Line Interface (CLI) or by using one of the AWS SDKs to\nimplement applications in your preferred language. For more information,\nsee:\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html AWS CLI>\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/opsworks/AWSOpsWorksClient.html AWS SDK for Java>\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/latest/apidocs/html/N_Amazon_OpsWorks.htm AWS SDK for .NET>\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php-2/latest/class-Aws.OpsWorks.OpsWorksClient.html AWS SDK for PHP 2>\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSRubySDK/latest/AWS/OpsWorks/Client.html AWS SDK for Ruby>\n-   <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforjavascript/ AWS SDK for Node.js>\n-   <http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/ref/opsworks.html AWS SDK for Python(Boto)>\n__Endpoints__\nAWS OpsWorks supports only one endpoint,\nopsworks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS), so you must connect to that\nendpoint. You can then use the API to direct AWS OpsWorks to create\nstacks in any AWS Region.\n__Chef Versions__\nWhen you call CreateStack, CloneStack, or UpdateStack we recommend you\nuse the @ConfigurationManager@ parameter to specify the Chef version.\nThe recommended value for Linux stacks, which is also the default value,\nis currently 11.10. Windows stacks use Chef 12.2. For more information,\nsee\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingcookbook-chef11.html Chef Versions>.\nYou can also specify Chef 11.4 or Chef 0.9 for your Linux stack.\nHowever, Chef 0.9 has been deprecated. We do not recommend using Chef\n0.9 for new stacks, and we recommend migrating your existing Chef 0.9\nstacks to Chef 11.10 as soon as possible.\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.OpsWorks\" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\nto get started.";
