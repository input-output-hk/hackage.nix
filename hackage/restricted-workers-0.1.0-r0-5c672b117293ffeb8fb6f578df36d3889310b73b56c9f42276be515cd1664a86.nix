To read more about the idia behind the\nlibrary check out my GSoC report:\n<http://parenz.wordpress.com/2013/07/15/interactive-diagrams-gsoc-progress-report/>.\n\nThe library provides a convenient way of running worker processes,\nsaving data obtained by the workers at start-up, a simple pool\nabstraction and a configurable security and resource limitations.\nPlease consult\n<https://github.com/co-dan/interactive-diagrams/tree/master/restricted-workers/README.md>\nand\n<https://github.com/co-dan/interactive-diagrams/wiki/Restricted-Workers>\nfor more details.\n\n/Warning/: this library requires SELinux to\nfunction";
