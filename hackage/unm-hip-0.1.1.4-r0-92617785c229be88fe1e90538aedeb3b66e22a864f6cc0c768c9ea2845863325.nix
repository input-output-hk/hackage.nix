The library was designed for use in UNM's Digital Image Processing class but it can be used for a wide range of image processing purposes.\n\n[Changes]\n\n* Export the Data.Complex module from Data.Image.Complex\n\n* Added instance RealFloat a => Ord (C.Complex a) where\n\n* Fixed a bug in normalize that was producing images with NaN pixel values\n\n* Removed (~) class of functions to reduce confusion.";
