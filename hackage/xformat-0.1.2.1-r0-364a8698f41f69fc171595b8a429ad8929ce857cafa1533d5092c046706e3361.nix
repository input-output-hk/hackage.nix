      description = "This package is composed of two functions for formatted conversion between\nstrings and typed values. Each is defined as a type-indexed function using a\ntype class with multiple parameters and functional dependencies along with\nformat descriptors.\n\n\"Text.XFormat.Read\" allows one to parse values from a formatted string. Its\nfunctionality is similar to the C @scanf@ function. Unlike @scanf@, however,\nthe format descriptor is well-typed, ensuring that the output type is\nstatically known.\n\n\"Text.XFormat.Show\" allows one to print values to a formatted string. Its\nfunctionality is similar to the C @printf@ function. Unlike @printf@, however,\nthe format descriptor is well-typed, ensuring that the variable number\narguments are statically known.\n\nThese functions can be easily extended to support new formats and new types.\nExtension is simple: define a format descriptor and an instance of the\nappropriate class.";
