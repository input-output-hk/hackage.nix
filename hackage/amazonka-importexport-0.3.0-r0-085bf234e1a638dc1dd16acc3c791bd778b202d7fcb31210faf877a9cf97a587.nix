AWS transfers your data\ndirectly onto and off of storage devices using Amazonâ€™s high-speed internal\nnetwork and bypassing the Internet. For significant data sets, AWS\nImport/Export is often faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective\nthan upgrading your connectivity.\n\n/See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/DG/api-reference.html AWS API Reference>\n\n/Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under\nheavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!";
