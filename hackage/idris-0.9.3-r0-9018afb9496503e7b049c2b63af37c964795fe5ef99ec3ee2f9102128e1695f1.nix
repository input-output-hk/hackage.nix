The language is closely\nrelated to Epigram and Agda. There is a tutorial at <http://www.idris-lang.org/documentation>.\nFeatures include:\n\n* Full dependent types with dependent pattern matching\n\n* where clauses, with rule, simple case expressions,\npattern matching let and lambda bindings\n\n* Type classes, monad comprehensions\n\n* do notation, idiom brackets, syntactic conveniences for lists,\ntuples, dependent pairs\n\n* Indentation significant syntax, extensible syntax\n\n* Tactic based theorem proving (influenced by Coq)\n\n* Cumulative universes\n\n* Simple foreign function interface (to C)\n\n* Hugs style interactive environment";
