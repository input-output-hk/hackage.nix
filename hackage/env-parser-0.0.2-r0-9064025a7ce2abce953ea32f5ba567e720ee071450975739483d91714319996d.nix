It's goals and design are similar to that of @cmdargs@\nor @optparse-applicative@ but aimed at automatically managed programs such as\nthose that might be run via Heroku or Runit/daemontools.\n\n@env-parser@ intentionally sacrifices power for comprehensibility---the\nprimary interface, @Parser@, implements only @Applicative@. This provides\nbetter runtime error messages and automatically generated static help using\nparser annotations. It also expresses a principle of simplicity in\nconfiguration: arbitrary uses of @Monad@ or even @Alternative@ can lead to\nopaque failures prior to a program even beginning to run.";
