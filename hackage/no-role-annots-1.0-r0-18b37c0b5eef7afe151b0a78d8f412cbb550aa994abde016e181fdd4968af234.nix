The module\nLanguage.Haskell.RoleAnnots exports backward-compatible declarations\nusable to assign stricter roles to declarations. Proper role annotations\nare preferred, but these work, too.\nThe module Language.Haskell.RoleAnnots.Check provides a way to check\nthat a datatype has a set of desired roles. This might be suitable for\nuse in a testsuite.\nSee the module documentation for details.\nNote that this package works only with GHC 7.4 and up, because it depends\non the -XPolyKinds extension. If you need backward compatibility before\n7.4, then please look at the source code and adapt the definitions to the\nkinds of the variables in your program.";
