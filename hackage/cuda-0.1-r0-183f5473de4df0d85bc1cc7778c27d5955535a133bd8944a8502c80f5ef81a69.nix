You will need to install the CUDA driver and\ndeveloper toolkit (tested with v2.3).\n\n<http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda.html>\n\nNote that on Snow Leopard, the c2hs preprocessor is confused by the notation\nfor Apple's Blocks extension, so to work around this:\n\n> cabal install --c2hs-option=-ccpp-4.0\n";
