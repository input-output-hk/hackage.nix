      description = "Traditional buffer-overflow attacks work by filling a data buffer with\nexploit code and then redirecting execution to that buffer.  As a\ncountermeasure, modern operating systems will forbid (by default) the\nexecution of writable memory regions.\n\nReturn-oriented programming [1] is an alternative exploitation strategy\nthat works around this restriction.  The exploit payload is built by\nchaining together short code sequences (\\\"gadgets\\\") which are already\npresent in the exploited program, and thus are allowed to be executed.\n\ndewdrop is a Haskell library for finding useful gadgets in 32- and 64-bit\nx86 ELF binaries.  You can describe the desired gadget properties with a\nHaskell function, and use the @Dewdrop@ module to make a customized\ngadget-finder program.  Or you can import @Dewdrop.Analyze@ and integrate\nthis functionality into a larger program.\n\n\\[1\\] Shacham, Hovav. /The Geometry of Innocent Flesh on the Bone:/\n/Return-into-libc without Function Calls (on the x86)/.
