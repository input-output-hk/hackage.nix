The packages are split as it is expected they\nwill have different development speeds - @Wumpus-Basic@ needs\npolishing and refinement; @Wumpus-Drawing@ simply needs a lot of\nwork to move its components from /proof-of-concept/ ideas to\nbeing readily usable.\n\n\nNOTE - the demos that were previously included are now in the\npackage @Wumpus-Drawing@.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\nv0.14.0 to v0.15.0:\n\n* Split previous @Wumpus-Basic@ package into two packages:\n@Wumpus-Basic@ and @Wumpus-Drawing@. This is a pratical move\nto separate the developed (although not yet polished) @Kernel@\nand @FontLoader@ code from the prototypical @Drawing@ code.\n\n* Renamed the @Drawing@ object to @CtxPicture@. Although\n@CtxPicture@ is a less pleasant name, it should be less\nconfusing. A @CtxPicture@ is the essentially the @Picture@\ntype from Wumpus-Core with an implicit context -\n@ContextPicture@ is simply too long and @CtxPicture@ is\nalmost jibberish but the previous unrelated name @Drawing@\nwas not helpful.\n\n* @Kernel.Base.ScalingContext@ has been simplified.\nScalingContexts are no longer manipulated via a custom Reader\nmonad or transformer as the type signatures were too unwieldy.\n\n* Added @TextMargin@ to the @DrawingContext@ - Wumpus-Drawing\ncan now calculate more appealing bounding boxes for text.\n";
