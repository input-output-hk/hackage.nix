      synopsis = "XML parser/formatter based on expat";
      description = "This package provides a general purpose Haskell XML library using Expat to\ndo its parsing (<http://expat.sourceforge.net/> - a fast stream-oriented XML\nparser written in C).  It is extensible to any string type, with @String@,\n@ByteString@ and @Text@ provided out of the box.\n\nBasic usage: Parsing a tree (/Tree/), formatting a tree (/Format/).\nOther features: Helpers for processing XML trees (/Proc/), trees annotated with\nXML source location (/Annotated/), extended XML trees with comments,\nprocessing instructions, etc (/Extended/), XML cursors (/Cursor/),\nSAX-style parse (/SAX/), and access to the low-level interface in case speed\nis paramount (/Internal.IO/).\n\nThe design goals are speed, speed, speed, interface simplicity and modularity.\n\nFor introduction and examples, see the /Text.XML.Expat.Tree/ module. For benchmarks,\n<http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hexpat/>\n\nIf you want to do interactive I\\/O, an obvious option is to use lazy parsing\nwith one of the lazy I\\/O functions such as hGetContents.  However, this can be\nproblematic in some applications because it doesn't handle I\\/O errors properly\nand can give no guarantee of timely resource cleanup. Because of the generalized\nlist, Hexpat is designed to allow for chunked I/O, but as of this writing I haven't\ndone a nice integration with enumerator and friends.\n\n/IO/ is filed under /Internal/ because it's low-level and most users won't want\nit.  The other /Internal/ modules are re-exported by /Annotated/, /Tree/ and /Extended/,\nso you won't need to import them directly.\n\nCredits to Iavor Diatchki and the @xml@ (XML.Light) package for /Proc/ and /Cursor/.\nThanks to the many contributors.\n\nChangeLog: 0.15 changes intended to fix a (rare) \\\"error: a C finalizer called back into Haskell.\\\"\nthat seemed only to happen only on ghc6.12.X; 0.15.1 Fix broken Annotated parse;\n0.16 switch from mtl to transformers; 0.17 fix mapNodeContainer & rename some things.;\n0.18 rename defaultEncoding to overrideEncoding. 0.18.3 formatG and indent were demanding list\nitems more than once (inefficient in chunked processing); 0.19 add Extended.hs;\n0.19.1 fix a memory leak introduced in 0.19, delegate parsing to bound thread\nif unbound (see note above); 0.19.2 include expat source code so \\'cabal install\\' just works\non Linux, Mac and Windows (thanks Jacob Stanley); 0.19.3 fix misconfiguration of expat\nwhich broke entity parsing; 0.19.4 bump version constraint for text; 0.19.5 bump text\nto < 0.12 and fix text-0.10.0.1 breakage; 0.19.6 dependency breakage with List;\n0.19.7 ghc-7.2.1 compatibility; 0.19.8 fix space leak on lazy parse under ghc-7.2.1;\n0.19.9 fix formatting of > character + improve performance; 0.19.10 ghc-7.4.x compatibility;\n0.20.1 fix an unfortunate crash when used in parallel processing and greatly improve\nperformance; 0.20.2 make parseSaxG lazier; 0.20.3 minor build issues; 0.20.4 remove\ndependency on extensible-exceptions; 0.20.5 bump text upper bound; 0.20.6 bump text again\nto include 1.1.x.x; 0.20.7 bump text again for 1.2.x.x; 0.20.8 bump utf8-string dep;\n0.20.9 bump deepseq dep/ghc-7.10 compatibility.; 0.20.10 increase dependency upper bounds";
