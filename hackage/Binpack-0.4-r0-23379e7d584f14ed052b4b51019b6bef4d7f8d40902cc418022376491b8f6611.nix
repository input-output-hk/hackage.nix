Items can be packed in order of both decreasing and increasing\nsize (and, of course, in unmodified order).\n\nThe module supports both the standard (textbook) minimization problem\n(/How many bins do I need?/) and the more practical fitting problem\n(/I've got n bins; which items can I take?/).\n\nThe API is simple and the module is documented with Haddock (complete with\nexamples). The implementation of the above-mentioned heuristics is complete\nand partially tested with QuickCheck. However, note that speed has not been a\nprimary concern to date.\n\nPatches and feedback are very welcome.";
