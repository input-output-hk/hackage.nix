Attempting to construct an infinite\ngrouped list will result in an infinite loop.\n\n* Grouped lists internally represent consecutive equal elements as only\none, hence the name of /grouped lists/.\n\nThis mean that grouped lists are ideal for cases where the list has many\nrepetitions (like @[1,1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2]@, although they might\npresent some deficiencies in the absent of repetitions.";
