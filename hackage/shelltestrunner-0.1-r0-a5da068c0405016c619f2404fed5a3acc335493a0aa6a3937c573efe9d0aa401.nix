This\nwas extracted from the hledger project, and inspired\nby the tests in John Wiegley's ledger project.\nThis uses test-framework's test runner.  Output order\nis currently a bit mixed up. Any command-line options\nare passed through to the test-framework runner, but\nthey must not contain spaces, so use eg -tpattern not\n-t pattern. You may be able to get a big speedup by\nrunning tests in parallel: try -j8.\nUsage:\n\$ shelltestrunner [testrunneropts] executable testfile1 [testfile2 ...]\nTest file format:\n-opt1 -opt2 arg1 arg2\n<<<\n0 or more lines of input\n>>>\n0 or more lines of expected output\n>>>2\n0 or more lines of expected error output\n<<<expected numeric exit code>>>\nLines whose first non-whitespace character is ; are\nignored, mostly.  The first line is the command line,\nto be appended to the executable name.  All remaining\nfields are optional; when omitted they are assumed\nto be \"\", \"\", \"\", and 0 respectively.";
