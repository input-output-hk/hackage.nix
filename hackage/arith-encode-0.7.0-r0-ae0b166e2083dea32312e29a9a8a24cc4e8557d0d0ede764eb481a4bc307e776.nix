The underlying theory is that of isomorphisms with the natural\nnumbers (known as Godel numbering).  The library provides functionality for defining\nmultiple such encodings for a given datatype, as well as a collection of stock\nencodings and combinators which can be used to build more complex encodings.\n\nThis has various uses, among them binary serialization/deserialization and\nenumeration testing.\n\nThis is the second release candidate for 1.0 (initial release).";
