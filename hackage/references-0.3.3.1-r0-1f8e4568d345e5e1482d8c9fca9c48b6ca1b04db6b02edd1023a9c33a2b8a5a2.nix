      description = "References are data accessors that can read, write or update the accessed infromation through their context. They are first-class values, can be passed in functions, transformed, combined. References generalize lenses, folds and traversals for haskell (see: < https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens>).\n\nReferences are more general than field selectors in traditional languages.\n\n* References are first-class values. If there is a struct in C, for example, with an `int` field `fl`, then fl can only be used as part of an expression. One can not generalize a function to take a field selector and transform the selected data or use it in other ways.\n\n* They can have different meanings, while field accessors can only represent data-level containment. They can express uncertain containment (like field selectors of C unions), different viewpoints of the same data, and other concepts.\n\nThere are two things that references can do but the previously mentioned access methods don't.\n\n* References can cooperate with monads, for example IO. This opens many new applications.\n\n* References can be added using the @&+&@ operator, to create new lenses more easily.\n\nBasic idea taken from the currently not maintained package <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yall>.\n\nAn example use of the references (a logger application that spawns new threads to update a global log):\n\n> logger =\n>   (forever \$ do\n>      log <- logChan ^? chan&logRecord    -- Extract the log record from the received log message\n>      thrId <- forkIO (do time <- getTime\n>                          ioref&lastLogTime != time \$ logDB     -- Update the last logging time mutable log database\n>                          let logMsg = senderThread .- show     -- Transform the thread id to a string and\n>                                         \$ loggingTime .= time  -- update the time\n>                                         \$ log                  -- inside the log message\n>                          ioref&debugInfos !~ addLogEntry log \$ logDB  -- update the table of log entries\n>                          mvar !- (+1) \$ count )\n>      mvar !- (thrId:) \$ updaters                               -- Record the spawned thread\n>     ) `catch` stopUpdaters updaters\n>   where stopUpdaters updaters ThreadKilled =\n>           mvar&traverse !| killThread \$ updaters               -- Kill all spawned threads before stopping\n\nThere are a bunch of predefined references for datatypes included in standard libraries.\n\nNew references can be created in several ways:\n\n* From getter, setter and updater, using the @reference@ function.\n\n* From getter and setter, using one of the simplified functions (@lens@, @simplePartial@, @partial@, ...).\n\n* Using the `Data.Traversal` instance on a datatype to generate a traversal of each element.\n\n* Using lenses from `Control.Lens` package. There are a lot of packages defining lenses, folds and traversals\nfor various data structures, so it is very useful that all of them can simply be converted into a reference.\n\n* Generating references for newly defined datatypes using the `makeReferences` Template Haskell function.\n";
