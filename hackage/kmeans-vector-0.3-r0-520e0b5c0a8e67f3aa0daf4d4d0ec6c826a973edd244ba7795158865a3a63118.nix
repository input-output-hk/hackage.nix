The goal of this algorithm is to, given a set of n-dimensional points, regroup them in k groups, such that each point gets to be in the group to which it is the closest to (using the 'center' of the group).\n\nCHANGELOG\n\n0.3: total rewrite of the code, the code scales much better on big inputs and is overall\nconsistently faster than the other kmeans implementations on hackage, on my laptop.\n0.2: supports having feature vectors associated to objects, and thus computing kmeans on these vectors, letting you recover the initial objects.";
