The CλaSH compiler transforms these high-level descriptions to\nlow-level synthesizable VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.\n\nFeatures of CλaSH:\n\n* Strongly typed, but with a very high degree of type inference, enabling both\nsafe and fast prototyping using concise descriptions.\n\n* Interactive REPL: load your designs in an interpreter and easily test all\nyour component without needing to setup a test bench.\n\n* Higher-order functions, with type inference, result in designs that are\nfully parametric by default.\n\n* Synchronous sequential circuit design based on streams of values, called\n@Signal@s, lead to natural descriptions of feedback loops.\n\n* Support for multiple clock domains, with type safe clock domain crossing.\n\n\nThis package provides:\n\n* Prelude library containing datatypes and functions for circuit design\n\nTo use the library:\n\n* Import \"Clash.Prelude\"\n\n* Alternatively, if you want to explicitly route clock and reset ports,\nfor more straightforward multi-clock designs, you can import the\n\"Clash.Explicit.Prelude\" module. Note that you should not import\n\"Clash.Prelude\" and \"Clash.Explicit.Prelude\" at the same time as they\nhave overlapping definitions.\n\nA preliminary version of a tutorial can be found in \"Clash.Tutorial\", for a\ngeneral overview of the library you should however check out \"Clash.Prelude\".\nSome circuit examples can be found in \"Clash.Examples\".";
