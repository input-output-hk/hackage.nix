See\n\n> mathgenealogy --help\n\nfor the complete list of options. Requires the /dot/ program, which is\npart of the GraphViz package (/version 2.28.0 or later!/) to run.\n\nFeedback and bug reports are appreciated!\n\n/Changes in 1.3.0:/\n\n* Switched to HTML-like labels in GraphViz. This is required for the advanced\nfont formatting options. ATTENTION: this needs a recent\ninstallation of GraphViz (Linux: 2.28.0; MacOS: 2.29) and will yield\nbest results for SVG output files. If you have an older version of GraphViz\nor run into issues, try the '--oldtextlabels' option.\n\n* Downloaded entries are stored locally. This avoids re-downloading the same\ndata if you want to generate multiple graphs of the same entry with\ndifferent formatting options.\n\n* Added more options for fine-tuning the fonts and colors. (requested by users)\n\n* Default output is now SVG, as this is the format best supported by GraphViz.\n\n/Changes in 1.2.0:/\n\n* Fixed handling of entries that have multiple degrees. (reported by Dima Pasechnik)\n\n/Changes in 1.1.1:/\n\n* Provide error message when given invalid start URL\n\n* Documentation and code cleanup\n\n/Changes in 1.0.0:/\n\n* Choice between PDF and PNG output\n\n* Optional inclusion of PhD theses in output\n\n/Changes in 0.0.2:/\n\n* Fixed handling of trailing commas (reported by Alexander Koessler)";
