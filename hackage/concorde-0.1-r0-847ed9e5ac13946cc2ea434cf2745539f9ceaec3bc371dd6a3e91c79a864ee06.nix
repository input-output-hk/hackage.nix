It quickly produces good tours, which may not be optimal.  You\ncan directly control the tradeoff between run time and solution quality.\n\nAn example program is included.\n\nCurrently, only problems in two-dimensional Euclidean space are supported.\n\nMore features of Concorde can be added on request.  Feature requests and\npatches are always welcome.";
