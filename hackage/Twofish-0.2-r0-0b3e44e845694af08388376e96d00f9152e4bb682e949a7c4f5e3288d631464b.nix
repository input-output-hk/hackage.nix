In the future, these should probably either be\nmoved to their own package, or all of this should be merged\ninto the Crypto package.\n\nAcknowledgments:\n\nDominic Steinitz and Creighton Hogg for their work on the Crypto\npackage, upon which this package depends (particularily for the\nData.LargeWord module).\n\nStephen Tetley for his advice and code examples provided on\nthe Haskell-Beginners mailing list in response to a question\nI had, which helped me to create a transformer version of the Cbc monad.";
