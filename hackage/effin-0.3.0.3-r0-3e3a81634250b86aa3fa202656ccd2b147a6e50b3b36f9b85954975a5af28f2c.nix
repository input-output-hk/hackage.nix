      description = "This package implements extensible effects, an alternative to monad\ntransformers. The original paper can be found at\n<http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/exteff.pdf>. The main differences\nbetween this library and the one described in the paper are that this library\ndoes not use the Typeable type class, does not require that effects implement\nthe Functor type class, and has a simpler API for handling\neffects.\n\nFor example, the following code implements a handler for exceptions:\n\n> newtype Exception e = Throw e\n>\n> runException :: Effect (Exception e :+ es) a -> Effect es (Either e a)\n> runException = eliminate\n>     (\\x -> return (Right x))\n>     (\\(Throw e) k -> return (Left e))\n\nCompare this to the corresponding code in extensible-effects\n(<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/extensible-effects>):\n\n> runExc :: Typeable e => Eff (Exc e :> r) a -> Eff r (Either e a)\n> runExc = loop . admin\n>   where\n>     loop (Val x) = return (Right x)\n>     loop (E u)   = handleRelay u loop (\\(Exc e) -> return (Left e))\n\nIn particular, effect implementors are not required to do any recursion,\nthereby making effect handlers more composeable.";
