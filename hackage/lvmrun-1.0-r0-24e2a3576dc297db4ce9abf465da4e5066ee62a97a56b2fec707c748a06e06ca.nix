This cabal package defines an LVM runtime written in C.\nThe core assembler (coreasm) for compiling core programs into LVM instructions\nand a library is defined in the lvmlib cabal package. The LVM is used\nas a backend for the Helium compiler. More information about LVM can be\nfound in Chapter 6 of Daan Leijen's PhD Thesis, The Lambda Abroad.\nWe use the Make build-type here. The dependencies are provided in the Cabal\nfile, and their generation is not handled by Cabal. Instead, if you change\ndependencies please run `make depend'. This occurs extremely rarely, though,\nbecause we do not plan to evolve lvmrun.\nFornothing.hs is only there to please Cabal.";
