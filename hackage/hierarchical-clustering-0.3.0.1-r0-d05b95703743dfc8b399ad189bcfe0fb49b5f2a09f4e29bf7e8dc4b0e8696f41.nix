      description = "This package provides a function to create a dendrogram from a\nlist of items and a distance function between them.  Initially\na singleton cluster is created for each item, and then new,\nbigger clusters are created by merging the two clusters with\nleast distance between them.  The distance between two clusters\nis calculated according to the linkage type.  The dendrogram\nrepresents not only the clusters but also the order on which\nthey were created.\n\nThis function uses a na√Øve algorithm that represents distances\nin a rectangular distance matrix.  There could be space\nimprovements (e.g. using a triangular matrix structure) and\ntime improvements (e.g. using a finger tree to avoid traversing\nthe whole matrix on every iteration just to see what the\nminimum is).\n\nChanges in version 0.3.0.1:\n\n* Listed changes of unreleased version 0.2.\n\nChanges in version 0.3:\n\n* Added function @cutAt@.\n\n* Fixed complexity in Haddock comments.\n\nChanges in version 0.2:\n\n* Added function @elements@.\n\n* Added separate functions for each linkage type.  This may be\nuseful if you want to create a dendrogram and your distance\ndata type isn't an instance of @Floating@.";
