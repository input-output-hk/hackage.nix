The latter\nuses the @clientsession@ package to encrypt the cookie for\nsecurity.  In both extensions, sessions are protected from\nsession stealing by checking the source IP address, and\nhave a configurable timeout (optional for the cookie-\nbacked back end).  The session type is user-defined.\n\nIn addition, a library is provided for a continuation-\nbased programming model called dialogues, which allows\nnatural specification of stateful interactions with the\nclient that span multiple requests.  Because the session\ntype is not serializable, this requires the memory-backed\nimplementation.";
