Amazon CloudWatch\nLogs enables you to monitor, store, and access your system, application,\nand custom log files. This guide provides detailed information about\nAmazon CloudWatch Logs actions, data types, parameters, and errors. For\ndetailed information about Amazon CloudWatch Logs features and their\nassociated API calls, go to the\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide Amazon CloudWatch Developer Guide>.\nUse the following links to get started using the /Amazon CloudWatch Logs\nAPI Reference/:\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html Actions>:\nAn alphabetical list of all Amazon CloudWatch Logs actions.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html Data Types>:\nAn alphabetical list of all Amazon CloudWatch Logs data types.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html Common Parameters>:\nParameters that all Query actions can use.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html Common Errors>:\nClient and server errors that all actions can return.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html Regions and Endpoints>:\nItemized regions and endpoints for all AWS products.\nIn addition to using the Amazon CloudWatch Logs API, you can also use\nthe following SDKs and third-party libraries to access Amazon CloudWatch\nLogs programmatically.\n-   <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforjava/ AWS SDK for Java Documentation>\n-   <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkfornet/ AWS SDK for .NET Documentation>\n-   <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforphp/ AWS SDK for PHP Documentation>\n-   <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforruby/ AWS SDK for Ruby Documentation>\nDevelopers in the AWS developer community also provide their own\nlibraries, which you can find at the following AWS developer centers:\n-   <http://aws.amazon.com/java/ AWS Java Developer Center>\n-   <http://aws.amazon.com/php/ AWS PHP Developer Center>\n-   <http://aws.amazon.com/python/ AWS Python Developer Center>\n-   <http://aws.amazon.com/ruby/ AWS Ruby Developer Center>\n-   <http://aws.amazon.com/net/ AWS Windows and .NET Developer Center>\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.CloudWatchLogs\" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\nto get started.";
