      description = "`Stream` can be used wherever `FreeT` is used. The compiler's\nstandard range of optimizations work better for operations\nwritten in terms of `Stream`. See the examples in @Streaming.Prelude@\nfor a sense of how simple the library is to use and think about.\n\n@Streaming.Prelude@ closely follows\n@Pipes.Prelude@, but cleverly /omits the pipes/. It is focused\non employment with base functors which generate\neffectful sequences. These appear elsewhere under titles like\n\n> pipes:      Producer a m r, Producer a m (Producer a m r), FreeT (Producer a m) m r\n> io-streams: InputStream a, Generator a r\n> conduit:    Source m a, ConduitM () o m r\n\nand the like.\n\nInteroperation with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes pipes>\nis accomplished with this isomorphism:\n\n> Pipes.unfoldr Streaming.next        :: Stream (Of a) m r   -> Producer a m r\n> Streaming.unfoldr Pipes.next        :: Producer a m r      -> Stream (Of a) m r\n\nInteroperation with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams io-streams>\nis thus:\n\n> Streaming.reread IOStreams.read     :: InputStream a       -> Stream (Of a) IO ()\n> IOStreams.unfoldM Streaming.uncons  :: Stream (Of a) IO () -> IO (InputStream a)\n\nA simple exit to <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit conduit> would be, e.g.:\n\n> Conduit.unfoldM Streaming.uncons    :: Stream (Of a) m ()  -> Source m a\n\nThese conversions should never be more expensive than a single @>->@ or @=\$=@.\n";
