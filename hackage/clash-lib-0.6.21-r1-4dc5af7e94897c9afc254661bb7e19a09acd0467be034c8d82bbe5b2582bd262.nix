The CλaSH compiler transforms these high-level descriptions to\nlow-level synthesizable VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.\n\nFeatures of CλaSH:\n\n* Strongly typed (like VHDL), yet with a very high degree of type inference,\nenabling both safe and fast prototying using consise descriptions (like\nVerilog).\n\n* Interactive REPL: load your designs in an interpreter and easily test all\nyour component without needing to setup a test bench.\n\n* Higher-order functions, with type inference, result in designs that are\nfully parametric by default.\n\n* Synchronous sequential circuit design based on streams of values, called\n@Signal@s, lead to natural descriptions of feedback loops.\n\n* Support for multiple clock domains, with type safe clock domain crossing.\n\n\nThis package provides:\n\n* The CoreHW internal language: SystemF + Letrec + Case-decomposition\n\n* The normalisation process that brings CoreHW in a normal form that can be\nconverted to a netlist\n\n* Blackbox/Primitive Handling\n\n\nFront-ends (for: parsing, typecheck, etc.) are provided by separate packages:\n\n* <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/clash-ghc GHC/Haskell Frontend>\n\n* <https://github.com/christiaanb/Idris-dev Idris Frontend>\n\n\nPrelude library: <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/clash-prelude>";
