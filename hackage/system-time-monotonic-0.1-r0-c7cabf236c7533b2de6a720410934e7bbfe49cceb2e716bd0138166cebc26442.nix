It does\nnot (necessarily) provide high-resolution timing.\n\n* On Windows, this uses @GetTickCount64@, but falls back to\n@GetTickCount@ if it is not available.  @GetTickCount64@ was\nintroduced in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.\nSupport for @QueryPerformanceCounter@ is also available, but is not\nused by default, as it is less accurate in the long run than\n@GetTickCount@.\n\n* On Linux, this uses @clock_gettime@ with @CLOCK_MONOTONIC@.";
