Values and interfaces are\n/combined and separable/, which makes TVs ready to use and to reuse.\n\nTry out the examples in @src\\/Examples.hs@.\n\nFor more information, including examples, please see the project wiki\npage <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/TV>\n\nThis page and the module documentation pages have links to colorized\nsource code and to wiki pages where you can read and contribute /user\ncomments/.
