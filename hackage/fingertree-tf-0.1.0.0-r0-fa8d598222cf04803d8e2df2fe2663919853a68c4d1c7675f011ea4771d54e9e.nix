This is an implementation modified\nto use associated types instead of functional dependencies.\n\nSee the original paper\n\n* Ralf Hinze and Ross Paterson,\n\\\"Finger trees: a simple general-purpose data structure\\\",\n/Journal of Functional Programming/ 16:2 (2006) pp 197-217.\n<http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html>\n\nFor a tuned sequence type, see @Data.Sequence@ in the\n@containers@ package, which is a specialization of\nthis structure.\n\nExamples are not available in this package. However I am\nworking on an @fingertree-extensible@ package which will use\nan idea based on types a la carte to provide composable annotations\nand that package will include examples :D";
