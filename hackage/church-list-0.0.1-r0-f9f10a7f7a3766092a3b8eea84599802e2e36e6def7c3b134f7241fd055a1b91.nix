This allows for O(1) concatenation and snoc,\njust as difference lists do, but without requiring that every operation\n(such as map) render the list.\n\nAs motivation: Although difference lists are great for use with Writer, they\nare horrible for use with State, because getting the list and querying an\nelement will result in producing a structure which is thrown away.  With\nmlists, you can both append to, and inspect, the list in progress without\nany wasted work.";
