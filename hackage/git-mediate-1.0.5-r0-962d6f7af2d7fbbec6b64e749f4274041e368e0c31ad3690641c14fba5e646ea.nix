By applying these diffs to\nthe base version and the other version, you\nemulate the situation where the patch had already\nexisted when the other had been applied.\n\nReapply git-mediate, it will validate that you've\nindeed applied it correctly, and bam: conflict\ndisappeared!\n\nGit-mediate also lets you handle modify/delete\nconflicts (there's no sane way in git to show\nwhat the modification actually was)\n\nGit-mediate also streamlines jumping to the\nconflicts with your editor, either with the `-e`\noption to invoke your editor, or via the standard\nline number format, which is parsed by all major\neditors, to allow use of \"jump to next error\"\nkeys.\n\nGit-mediate especially shines with automatic\nsource transformation tools such as renamers.\n\nIn a conflicted state, re-apply a rename that\ncaused the conflict, run git-mediate without\nopening any files, and the conflicts are gone!";
