This library provides\na bridge between that system and Haskell (i.e. it is a LaTeX DSL).\n\nWrite LaTeX documents with all the advantages you already have in Haskell (recursion,\ntype system, high order functions, ...), create a LaTeX backend for your own program,\nmake analysis of LaTeX code through its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), find another way\nto pretty-printing values, ...\n\nSee the @examples@ directory in the source distribution to look some simple examples.\nIt would be good to get you started.
