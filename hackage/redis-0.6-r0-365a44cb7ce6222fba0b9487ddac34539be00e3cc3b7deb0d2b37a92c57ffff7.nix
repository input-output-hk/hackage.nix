      description = "Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is similar to memcached\nbut the dataset is not volatile. Values can be strings, exactly\nlike in memcached, but also lists, sets, and ordered sets.\n\nThis library is a Haskell driver for Redis. Note that this library\nsupports the most recent (actually the git one) version of Redis\nprotocol. Most of the functions will work correctly with stable version\nbut not all.\n\nChanges from v0.5:\n\n- zunion and zinter was renamed to zunionstore and zinterstore.\nImportant! It makes this version incompatible with older versions of Redis server.\n\n- new message type for pmessages: MPMessage\n\n- new reply type RParseError used for replies that was failed to convert from ByteString\n\n- new command added: setEx";
