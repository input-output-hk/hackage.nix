In addition to the polymorphism of\nSystem-F2 it supports region, effect and closure typing. Evaluation order is\nleft-to-right call-by-value by default, but explicit lazy evaluation is also supported.\nThere is a capability system to track whether objects are mutable or constant,\nand to ensure that computations that perform visible side effects are not suspended with\nlazy evaluation.\nSee the @ddc-tools@ package for a user-facing interpreter and compiler.";
