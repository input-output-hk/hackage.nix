I didn't really find one that\ndid what I wanted (specifically, handle connecting to servers and\ncalling event handlers, possibly with TLS), but which didn't\nimplement almost a full IRC bot for you. That takes out all the fun!\n\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/irc-conduit irc-conduit> and\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/irc-ctcp irc-ctcp> are my\nsolution to the first part of that, this is my solution to the\nlatter. It's a simple IRC client library that does the basics for\nyou, but isn't an all-singing, all-dancing, fully-featured IRC\n/application/. It is a merely a simple library.";
