The changes from the original paper on the ghc implementation\nare described here: <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Generics#Changes_from_the_paper>.\n\nFor more info and examples of usage please see the README file included  in the package\nand the API at <http://haggismcmutton.github.com/GenericPretty/>\n\nInstallation of the package is straightforward, if needed, instructions can be found,\nfor instance, here: <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal/How_to_install_a_Cabal_package>.";
