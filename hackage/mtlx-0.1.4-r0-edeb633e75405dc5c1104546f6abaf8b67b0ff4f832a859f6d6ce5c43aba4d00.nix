It currently\nsupports IdentityX, ReaderX, StateX, WriterX, RWSX, and ErrorX\nmonads (and their transformer versions).  All these copies can be\ncombined into a transformer stack, including any of the original\nmtl monads. Inspired by the original mtl.  That library was\ninspired by the paper /Functional Programming with Overloading and\nHigher-Order Polymorphism/, by Mark P Jones\n(<http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/springschool.html>), Advanced\nSchool of Functional Programming, 1995.  See the Examples.hs file\nfor usage.";
