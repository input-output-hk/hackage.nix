As a secondary benefit,  messages written to channels with\nno receive ports associated with them can be reliably garbage collected.\n\nIn addition, this module incorporates several of clean-ups and additions\nto the venerable Chan.  Most notably,  the deprecated thread-unsafe\nfunctions have been removed,  the ability to @duplicate@ Receive Ports\nhas been added,  the @sendMany@ operation allows for multiple messages\nto be sent atomically,  and the @split@ operation turns a single\nchannel into two.";
