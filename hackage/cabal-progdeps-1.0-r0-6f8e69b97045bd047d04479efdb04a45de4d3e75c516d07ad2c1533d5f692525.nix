This can be very helpful when\nadding version constraints to your package's dependencies in that it\nshows what your package is currently built (or configured to be\nbuilt) with.\n\nn.b. It's called \"progdeps\" instead of \"pkgdeps\" because it's\nexamining the build information in the current directory and not\nactual packages.\n\nUsage: cabal-progdeps\n\nWorks with cabal-dev and cabal.\n";
