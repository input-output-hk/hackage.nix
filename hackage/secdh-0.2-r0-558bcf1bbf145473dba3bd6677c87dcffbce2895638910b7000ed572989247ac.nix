This machine adds a heap of suspension\ncells to the structure managed by the machine, allowing fully-lazy\nevaluation, similar to Haskell. The machine operates directly on the\nsyntax tree, as Landin's machine does. The entire implementation,\nincluding parser, evaluator, and garbage collector, occupies just over\n1100 lines of code.";
