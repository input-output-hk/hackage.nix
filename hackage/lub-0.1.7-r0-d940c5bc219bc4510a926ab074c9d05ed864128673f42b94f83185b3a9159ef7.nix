It provides a 'lub' function\nthat is consistent with the 'unamb' operator but has a more liberal\nprecondition.  Where 'unamb' requires its arguments to equal when\nneither is bottom, 'lub' is able to synthesize a value from the\npartial information contained in both of its arguments.\n\nThis module also defines 'glb', which intersects information.\n\nProject wiki page: <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/lub>\n\n&#169; 2008 by Conal Elliott; BSD3 license.";
