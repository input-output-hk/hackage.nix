You can\nhot-reload individual running components as you make changes to\ntheir code.  It is designed to shorten the development cycle during\nthe development of long-running programs like servers, web\napplications and interactive user interfaces.\n\nIt can also be used in the context of batch-style programs:  Keep\nresources that are expensive to create in memory and reuse them\nacross module reloads instead of reloading/recomputing them after\nevery code change.\n\nTechnically this package is a safe and convenient wrapper around\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/foreign-store foreign-store>.";
