Conversion of values to and from JSON is almost\ncompletely automatic thanks to the @aeson@ library.\n\nThe JSON-RPC conduit is generic with respect to the channel used to exchange\ndata with the client. It can use a network connection or, for example,\nthe standard input / ouput  of a process. The latter is demonstrated by the\n@jsonrpc-conduit-demo@ executable, which can be compiled using the @demo@ flag.";
