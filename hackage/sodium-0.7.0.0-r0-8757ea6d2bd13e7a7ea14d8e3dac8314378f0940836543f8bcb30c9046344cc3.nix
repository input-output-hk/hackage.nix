This is part of a project to\nimplement reactive libraries with similar interfaces across a range of programming\nlanguages at <http://reactiveprogramming.org/>\n\n* Goals include simplicity and completeness.\n\n* Applicative style: Event implements Functor and Behaviour implements Applicative.\n\n* Instead of the common approach where inputs are fed into the front of a monolithic\n\\'reactimate\\', Sodium allows you to push inputs in from scattered places in IO.\n\n* Integration with IO: Extensible to provide lots of scope for lifting IO into FRP\nlogic.\n\n* Push-based imperative implementation.\n\nSee the /examples/ directory for test cases and examples.\n\nChanges:\n\n* 0.2.0.0 - Fix some value recursion deadlocks and improve docs;\n\n* 0.3.0.0 - Add mergeWith, make cross asynchronous;\n\n* 0.4.0.0 - API revamp to remove an excess type variable. Parallelism stuff to be rethought;\n\n* 0.5.0.0 - Improved tests cases + add Freecell example, API tweaks;\n\n* 0.5.0.1 - Internal improvements;\n\n* 0.5.0.2 - Fix multiple memory leaks;\n\n* 0.6     - Minor API changes, particular with accum;\n\n* 0.6.0.1 - ghc-7.8 compatibility;\n\n* 0.6.0.2 - Fix memory leak - see memory-test-8 & memory-test-8a;\n\n* 0.7.0.0 - Add split primitive.";
