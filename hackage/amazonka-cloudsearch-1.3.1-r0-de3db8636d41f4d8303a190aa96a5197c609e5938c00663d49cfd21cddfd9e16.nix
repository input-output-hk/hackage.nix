For example,\ncloudsearch.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. For a current list of supported\nregions and endpoints, see\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cloudsearch_region Regions and Endpoints>.\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.CloudSearch\" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/what-is-cloudsearch.html AWS API Reference>\nto get started.";
