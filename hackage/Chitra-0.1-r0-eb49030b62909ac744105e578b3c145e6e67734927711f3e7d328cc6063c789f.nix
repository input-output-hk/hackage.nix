      description = "Chitra in most Indian languages means \"Image\". This aim of this project is to build an VNC library that can be used to develop interactive graphical application. What I think will be the strength of Chitra would be its \"platform independence\". So, the idea is, the library would have a \"putpixel\" function which when called would render a pixel on an image buffer that would be rendered via the vnc server. For viewing and interactive with the aplication, one would use a standard VNC client. Eventually, I might chose to do this using the RDP protocol that even has support for sound.\nTo try out -\nJust do a make and you should have the executable *Main* created.\nRun ./Main <width> <height> <port>\nNow try connecting a vnc client to localhost:5900";
