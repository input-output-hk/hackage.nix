To keep updating, call this\nprogram/library every few minutes.\nA local cache of earlier tweets is kept in a file to make\nsure no duplicates are sent.\n\nTo build your own program on top of this library use the\n`atom2twitter` or `rss2twitter` functions. If you need\naccess to the complete feed instead of just individual\nindividual items, use the `feed2twitter` function.\n\nSee the `hackage2twitter` program for an example of how to\nuse this library.\n\nThe executable can be used as such:\n\n> \$ feed2twitter http://example.com/feed.rss username password cache-file 50 [--debug-mode]";
