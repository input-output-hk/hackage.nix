      description = "This package provides a FIFO channel for STM supporting a size limit.  When\nthis limit is reached, older entries are discarded to make way for newer\nentries.\n\nThe motivation for this is logging.  If log entries are written to a plain\n@TChan@, the program will use a lot of memory if it produces log entries\nfaster than they can be processed.  If log entries are written to a bounded\nchannel where writes block (e.g. the @stm-chans@ package), the program may\ndeadlock if the log channel fills up.  With 'Data.STM.RollingQueue', old\nentries will be discarded instead.\n\nPossible improvements (not available in 'Data.STM.RollingQueue') include:\n\n* Discard lower-priority entries first.\n\n* Discard every other entry, so some of the older entries will still be\navailable.";
