It is almost source\ncode compatible with the pickling functionality of the HXT package, to allow\nyou to switch easily between the two implementations. This implementation is\nsimpler and more limited than HXT, but considerably faster.\nThis package does not depend on HXT.\n\nDARCS repository:\n<http://code.haskell.org/hexpat-pickle/>\n\nInformation/tutorial about the picklers found in the HXT package:\n<http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HXT/Conversion_of_Haskell_data_from/to_XML>";
