This provides a way to embed effect systems into Haskell. For more information see with paper \\\"Embedding effect systems in Haskell\\\" by Orchard and Petricek <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dao29/publ/haskell14-effects.pdf> (Haskell, 2014) and the examples in <https://github.com/dorchard/effect-monad/tree/master/examples>.\n(note, this package was previously called 'ixmonad' until September 2014).";
