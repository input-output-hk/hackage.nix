This module has in part been inspired by Bryan\nO\\'Sullivan\\'s /riak/ client for Haskell.\n\n* /Database.Cassandra.Pool/: Handles a /pool/ of connections to\nmultiple servers in a cluster, splitting the load among them.\n\n* /Database.Cassandra.Types/: A common set of types used everywhere.\n\nPotential TODOs include:\n\n* Support for counters and batch mutators\n\n* Support for database admin operations\n\n* Support for composite column types";
