      description = "The @concurrent-extra@ package offers among other things the\nfollowing selection of synchronisation primitives:\n\n* @Broadcast@: Wake multiple threads by broadcasting a value.\n\n* @Event@: Wake multiple threads by signalling an event.\n\n* @Lock@: Enforce exclusive access to a resource. Also known as a\nbinary semaphore or mutex. The package additionally provides an\nalternative that works in the @STM@ monad.\n\n* @RLock@: A lock which can be acquired multiple times by the same\nthread. Also known as a reentrant mutex.\n\n* @ReadWriteLock@: Multiple-reader, single-writer locks. Used to\nprotect shared resources which may be concurrently read, but only\nsequentially written.\n\n* @ReadWriteVar@: Concurrent read, sequential write variables.\n\nBesides these synchronisation primitives the package also provides:\n\n* @Thread.Delay@: Arbitrarily long thread delays.\n\n* @Timeout@: Wait arbitrarily long for an IO computation to finish.\n\nPlease consult the API documentation of the individual modules for\nmore detailed information.\n\nThis package was inspired by the concurrency libraries of Java and\nPython.";
