A compatibility mode is provided for those\nwho need a drop-in replacement for Markdown.pl.\n\nIn contrast to existing tools for converting markdown\nto HTML, which use regex substitutions, pandoc has\na modular design: it consists of a set of readers,\nwhich parse text in a given format and produce a native\nrepresentation of the document, and a set of writers,\nwhich convert this native representation into a target\nformat. Thus, adding an input or output format requires\nonly adding a reader or writer.";
