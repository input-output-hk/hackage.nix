This only works for qualified imports!\nUnqualified imports are left untouched.\n\nIt's most convenient if bound to an editor key.\n\nRecent major changes:\n\n* version 1.0.0\n\n* Change name from FixImports to fix-imports, which is more unixy.\n\n* Change ghc-pkg parsing from String to Text.\nIt's noticeably faster.\n\n* Add a more flexible system for prioritizing imports.\nWhen there are several possibilities for a module name, they are all given\nto a single function to decide.  The config file moved from\nfix-imports-priority to .fix-imports and can now specify sort orders for\npackages and modules by prefix.\n\n* Make -i includes for non-existent dirs ignored instead of causing an\nerror.";
