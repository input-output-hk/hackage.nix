      description = "Aivika is a multi-paradigm simulation library which has\nthe following features:\n\n* allows defining recursive stochastic differential equations of\nSystem Dynamics (unordered as in maths via the recursive do-notation);\n\n* has a basic support of the event-driven paradigm of\nthe Discrete Event Simulation (DES);\n\n* has a basic support of the process-oriented paradigm of DES\nwith an ability to resume, suspend and cancel\nthe discontinuous processes;\n\n* allows working with the resources (you can define your own behaviour\nor use the predefined queue strategies);\n\n* allows customizing the queues (you can define your own behaviour\nor use the predefined queue strategies);\n\n* allows defining an infinite stream of data based on the\nprocess-oriented computation (designed but not tested in\nanyway - please be very careful when using it);\n\n* allows defining processors (actually, the Haskell arrows) that\noperate on infinite streams of data (designed but not tested\nin anyway - please be very careful when using them);\n\n* supports the activity-oriented paradigm of DES;\n\n* supports the basic constructs for the agent-based modeling;\n\n* allows creating combined discrete-continuous models;\n\n* the arrays of simulation variables are inherently supported\n(this is mostly a feature of Haskell itself);\n\n* supports the Monte-Carlo simulation;\n\n* the simulation model can depend on external parameters;\n\n* uses extensively the signals to notify the model about changing\nthe reference and variable values;\n\n* allows gathering statistics in time points;\n\n* hides the technical details in high-level simulation monads\n(three of them support the recursive do-notation).\n\nAivika itself is a light-weight engine with minimal dependencies.\nHowever, it has additional packages Aivika Experiment [1] and\nAivika Experiment Chart [2] that offer the following features:\n\n* automating the simulation experiments;\n\n* saving the results in CSV files;\n\n* plotting the deviation chart by rule 3-sigma, histogram,\ntime series, XY chart;\n\n* collecting the summary of statistical data;\n\n* parallel execution of the Monte-Carlo simulation;\n\n* have an extensible architecture.\n\nAll three libraries were tested on Linux, Windows and OS X.\n\nPlease read the PDF document An Introduction to\nAivika Simulation Library [3] for more details (a little outdated).\nThis document is included in the distributive of Aivika but\nyou can usually find a more recent version by the link provided.\n\nP.S.\n\nTwo items, streams and processors, are not yet tested. This is a\ngoal for the future version of Aivika. The main reason why I ever uploaded\nmy three packages is that the Aivika Experiment Chart package\nwas broken in its dependencies, namely, when using the charting\nlibrary. So, I decided to provide the compilable packages again.\n\nAlthough I would like to say that the mentioned streams and processors\nwill be the main improvement in the future version as they actually\nallow defining some DES models on a very high level as you would define\nthem with help of diagrams.\n\nAlso the queues and server are not tested carefully. Use at your own\nrisk. At least, the infinite queue seems to be working.\n\n\\[1] <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aivika-experiment>\n\n\\[2] <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aivika-experiment-chart>\n\n\\[3] <https://github.com/dsorokin/aivika/blob/master/doc/aivika.pdf>\n";
