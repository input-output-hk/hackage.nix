Long term\ngoals are focused around procedural content generation\nand include in-game content creation, auto-balancing\nand persistent content modification based on player behaviour.\n\nA larger game that depends on the LambdaHack library\nis Allure of the Stars, available from\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Allure>.\n\nNote: All modules in the library are kept visible,\nto let games override each, but reuse as many as possible.\nOTOH, to reflect that some modules are implementation details\nrelative to others, the source code adheres to the following\nconvention. If a module has the same name as a directory,\nthe module is the exclusive interface to the directory.\nNo references to the modules in the directory are allowed\nexcept from the interface module.";
