      description = "Free monads are useful for many tree-like structures and domain specific languages.\n\nIf @f@ is a 'Functor' then the free 'Monad' on @f@ is the type\nof trees whose nodes are labeled with the constructors of @f@. The word\n\\\"free\\\" is used in the sense of \\\"unrestricted\\\" rather than \\\"zero-cost\\\":\n@Free f@ makes no constraining assumptions beyond those given by @f@ and the\ndefinition of 'Monad'. As used here it is a standard term from the\nmathematical theory of adjoint functors.\n\nCofree comonads are dual to free monads. They provide convenient ways to talk\nabout branching streams and rose-trees, and can be used to annotate syntax\ntrees. The cofree comonad can be seen as a stream parameterized by a 'Functor'\nthat controls its branching factor.\n\nMore information on free monads, including examples, can be found in the\nfollowing blog posts:\n<http://comonad.com/reader/2008/monads-for-free/>\n<http://comonad.com/reader/2011/free-monads-for-less/>";
