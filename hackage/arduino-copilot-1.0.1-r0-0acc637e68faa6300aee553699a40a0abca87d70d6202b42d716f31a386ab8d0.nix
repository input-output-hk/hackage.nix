Other methods of deploying sketches to the\nArduino, such as the Arduino-Makefile, can also be used with a sketch\ngenerated by arduino-copilot.\n\nAll the messy details are abstracted away, letting you focus on the\ndesired behavior of the Arduino.\n\nCopilot is a stream (i.e., infinite lists) domain-specific language\n(DSL) in Haskell that compiles into embedded C. Copilot contains an\ninterpreter, multiple back-end compilers, and other verification tools.\n<https://copilot-language.github.io/>";
