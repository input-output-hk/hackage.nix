It provides a good balance of\nperformance, nice output for humans, and implementation simplicity.  For more\ninformation, see <http://alfedenzo.livejournal.com/170301.html> and\n<http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/73318.html>.\n\nNew in version 0.1.1: relaxed @containers@ dependency, so it should build on\nGHC 6.10.";
