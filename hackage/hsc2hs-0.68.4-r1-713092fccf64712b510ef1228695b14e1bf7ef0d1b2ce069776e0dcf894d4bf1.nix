It reads an\nalmost-Haskell source file with embedded special constructs, and\noutputs a real Haskell file with these constructs processed, based\non information taken from some C headers.  The extra constructs\nprovide Haskell counterparts of C types, values of C constants,\nincluding sizes of C types, and access to fields of C structs.\n\nFor more details, see the\n<http://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/master/users-guide/utils.html#writing-haskell-interfaces-to-c-code-hsc2hs hsc2hs section>\nin the GHC User's Guide.";
