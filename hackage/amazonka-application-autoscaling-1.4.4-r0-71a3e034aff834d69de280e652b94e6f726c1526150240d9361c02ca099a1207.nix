      description = "Application Auto Scaling is a general purpose Auto Scaling service for supported elastic AWS resources. With Application Auto Scaling, you can automatically scale your AWS resources, with an experience similar to that of Auto Scaling.\nApplication Auto Scaling supports scaling the following AWS resources:\n-   Amazon ECS services\n-   Amazon EC2 Spot fleet instances\nYou can use Application Auto Scaling to accomplish the following tasks:\n-   Define scaling policies for automatically adjusting your AWS resources\n-   Scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms\n-   View history of your scaling events\nApplication Auto Scaling is available in the following regions:\n-\n@\nus-east-1\n@\n-\n@\nus-west-1\n@\n-\n@\nus-west-2\n@\n-\n@\nap-southeast-1\n@\n-\n@\nap-southeast-2\n@\n-\n@\nap-northeast-1\n@\n-\n@\neu-central-1\n@\n-\n@\neu-west-1\n@\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.ApplicationAutoScaling\" or <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ the AWS Documentation>\nto get started.";
