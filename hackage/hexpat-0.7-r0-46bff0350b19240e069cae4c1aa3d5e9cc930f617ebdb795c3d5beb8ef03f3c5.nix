It is extensible\nto any string type, with @String@, @ByteString@ and @Text@ provided out of the box.\n\nThe emphasis is on speed and simplicity. If you want more complete and powerful\nXML libraries, consider using /HaXml/ or /HXT/ instead.\n\nExamples and benchmarks: <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hexpat/>\n\nDARCS repository: <http://code.haskell.org/hexpat/>";
