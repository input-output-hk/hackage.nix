This means that all CSS selectors\nand style rules are first class Haskell functions, which makes reuse and\ncomposability easy.\n\nThe project is described on <http://fvisser.nl/clay>.\n\nThe API documentation can be found in the top level module \"Clay\".\n\n> 0.3 -> 0.4\n>   - Added dynamic presentation. (thanks to chrisdone)\n>   - Float now has its own value, don't incorrectly share side. (thanks to chrisdone)\n>   - Added nil size constructor.\n>   - Slightly improved the gradient syntax.\n>   - Expose the Propery module by default.\n>   - Introduced shared 'all' value.";
