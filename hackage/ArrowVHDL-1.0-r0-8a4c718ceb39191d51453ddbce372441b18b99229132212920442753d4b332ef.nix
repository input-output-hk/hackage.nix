From the netlist the developer can generate various\nother formats by \"compiling\" the arrow into them. With this software\nthree basic compilers are shipped. One generates a simple textual\nrepresentation that helps debugging the actual circuit. Another\ngenerates VHDL representations of the circuit. The third one generates\nDOT syntax for visualization of circuits.";
