The former is primarily used for sending SMS whereas the\nlatter is used for showing desktop notifications when SMS are received.\ntpb additionally supports a number of additional management commands for\ncreating and deleting resources inside PushBullet.\npb-notify is responsible for integration with PushBullet's Universal\nCopy/Paste feature. It maintains an internal buffer that is kept in sync with\nPushBullet's clipboard. This buffer can be accessed via pb-notify's built-in\nHTTP server. A POST request to the /clip endpoint of the server will in turn\nsend the necessary request to PushBullet to set the clipboard of all\nconnected devices.";
