It also provides\n@lower@ which is the opposite of @lift@, and extracts underlying monads from monad transformers.\nGenerally speaking, MonadBi represents the relationship between monads that can be transformed into each other (atleast partially).\nNatural instances are provided for many Monad Transformers.";
