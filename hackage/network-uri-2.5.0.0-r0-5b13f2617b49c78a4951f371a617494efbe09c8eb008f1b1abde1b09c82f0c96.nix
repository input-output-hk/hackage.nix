If you're using the @Network.URI@\nmodule you can automatically get it from the right package by adding\nthis to your .cabal file:\n\n> flag network-uri\n>   description: Get Network.URI from the network-uri package\n>   default: True\n>\n> library\n>   -- ...\n>   if flag(network-uri)\n>     build-depends: network-uri >= 2.6, network >= 2.6\n>   else\n>     build-depends: network-uri < 2.6, network < 2.6\n\nThat is, get the module from either network < 2.6 or from\nnetwork-uri >= 2.6.";
