The fact that it's cryptographically\nweak has been known for years: this is a public analysis of the weakness. The\ngoal is to determine risk posed to users, and find safeguards if possible.\n\n\nThe code is geared for rapid interactive development with GHCI. Excuse the lax conventions.\n\nData.Digest.* implements and explores XSHA1, while Data.Codec.* contains applications.";
