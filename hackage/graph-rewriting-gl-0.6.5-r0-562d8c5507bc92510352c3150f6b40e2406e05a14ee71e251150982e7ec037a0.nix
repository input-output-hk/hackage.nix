The usage of the interface is the same for all applications. In the center you will see the graph. It might be moving around which is due the force-directed layouting. On the top-left corner you will find a menu with the individual rewriting rules of the rewriting system. The controls are described in the \"GraphRewriting.GL.UI\" module.";
