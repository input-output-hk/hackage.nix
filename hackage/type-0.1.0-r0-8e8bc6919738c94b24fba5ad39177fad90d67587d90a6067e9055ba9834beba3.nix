This is troublesome since monad transformer type constructors have by definition at least rank 2 kind.\nBy default only type constructors whose kind contains maximum of 8 units are supported, for example: @ * -> (* -> *) -> ((* -> *) -> *) -> * -> * @.\nThe provided generator allows one to support even more complex types.\nHowever be aware that the amount of code generated increases exponentially.";
