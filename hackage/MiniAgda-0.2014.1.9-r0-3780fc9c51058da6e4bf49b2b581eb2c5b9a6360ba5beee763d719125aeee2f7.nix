MiniAgda's termination checker is a\nfusion of sized types and size-change termination and supports\ncoinduction. Equality incorporates eta-expansion at record and\nsingleton types. Function arguments can be declared as static; such\narguments are discarded during equality checking and compilation.\nRecent features include bounded size quantification and destructor\npatterns for a more general handling of coinduction.";
