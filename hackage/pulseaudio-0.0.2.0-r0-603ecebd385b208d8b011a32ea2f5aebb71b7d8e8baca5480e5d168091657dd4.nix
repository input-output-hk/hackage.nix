At least for query/control.\nIf you are interested in doing this, but don't know how, feel free to contact me.\n\n\nIn package is a bit unrefined and rough. If you have better structure for\nmodules feel free to reorganize them and making a PR. This also means, don't\nsee this structur as fixed yet, it may change if someone has a better idea.";
