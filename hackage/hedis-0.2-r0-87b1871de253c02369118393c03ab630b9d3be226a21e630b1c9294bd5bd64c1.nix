This library is a Haskell client for the Redis\ndatastore. Compared to other Haskell client libraries it has some\nadvantages:\n\n[Complete Redis 2.4 command set:] All Redis commands\n(<http://redis.io/commands>) are available as haskell functions. The\nexceptions to the rule are the MONITOR and SYNC commands.\n\n[Pipelining \\\"Just Works\\\":] Commands are pipelined\n(<http://redis.io/topics/pipelining>) as much as possible without any\nwork by the user.\n\n[Enforced Pub\\/Sub semantics:] When subscribed to the Redis Pub\\/Sub server\n(<http://redis.io/topics/pubsub>), clients are not allowed to issue\ncommands other than subscribing to or unsubscribing from channels. This\nlibrary uses the type system to enforce the correct behavior.\n\nFor detailed documentation, see the \"Database.Redis\" module.";
