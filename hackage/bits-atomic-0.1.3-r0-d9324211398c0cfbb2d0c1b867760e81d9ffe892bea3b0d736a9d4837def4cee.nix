See these links for background:\n\n* GCC manual: <http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Atomic-Builtins.html>\n\n* GCC wiki: <http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Atomic>\n\n/Portability/: This package is primarily developed on a Linux system, but\nshould work wherever GCC >= 4 is available. It has been confirmed as working\non OSX. On Windows, it should work with Cygwin but currently fails for\nvanilla Haskell-Platform 2010.1.0.0 as it still packages GCC 3.x. An\ninstaller for updated versions of GCC is available at\n<http://www.mingw.org/> and should make this package work in connection with\nHaskell-Platform. Feedback on compatibility would be appreciated.\n\n/Testing:/ The following commands can be used to compile and run the test suite:\n\n> cabal unpack bits-atomic && cd bits-atomic-* # if not yet locally available\n> cabal configure -ftest\n> cabal build\n> cabal test\n\n/Recent changes/:\n\n* 0.1.3: Documentation updates, especially on portability. No functional\nchanges.\n\n* 0.1.2: Avoid using System.FilePath in Setup.hs to fix build failure on hackage";
