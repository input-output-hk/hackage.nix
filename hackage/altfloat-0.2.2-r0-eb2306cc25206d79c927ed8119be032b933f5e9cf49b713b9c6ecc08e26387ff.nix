      description = "A replacement for the standard Haskell floating point types and supporting\nfunctions.  There are a number of shortcomings which I feel severely hinder\nHaskell's utility for numerical computation.  These shortcomings include\n\n* There is no way to sanely convert between Haskell's floating types -- not\neven between Double and CDouble.  The implementation of the 'realToFrac'\nfunction goes through 'Rational', which loses information as 'Rational'\ncannot represent all floating point values.\n\n* Making floating types an instance of 'Ord' makes no sense.  'Ord' is for\ntotally ordered data types, which floats are not.  As a result, a number of\nlibrary functions (such as 'max' and 'sort') produce nonsensical results.\n\n* The 'Enum' instance for floating types similarly makes little sense.\nWhile 'fromEnum' and 'toEnum' functions use 'Int' instead of 'Integer',\nlimiting their usefulness, 'pred' and 'succ' can be defined in a much more\nuseful way.\n\n* Functions that should care about negative zeros, such as 'signum' and\n'abs', do not.\n\n* Some functions, such as 'floor', have nonsensical behaviour for\nnon-finite input.\n\n* The selection of floating point library functions pales in comparison to\nC.  This problem is made worse since, as noted above, it is impossible to\nconvert losslessly from 'Double' to 'CDouble' in order to use the FFI.\n\n* There is no mechanism for handling rounding modes or exceptions.\n\nThis package is intended to address all of the above issues, and more.  All\nare currently addressed except for rounding modes and exceptions.\n\nAlso provided, for convenience, is an alternative to the standard Prelude\nwhich includes features from this library and the non-overlapping parts of\nthe standard Prelude.";
