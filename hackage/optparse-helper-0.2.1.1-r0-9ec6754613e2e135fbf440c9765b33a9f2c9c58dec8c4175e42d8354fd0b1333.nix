This package exists to\nwork around those two.\n\nFor instance:\n\n* optparse-applicative does not show help on error by default.\n\n* optparse-applicative does not disambiguate commands. So, if you have a\ncommand @my-executable foobar@, but your user runs @my-executable f@,\noptparse-applicative will not disambiguate this by default.\n\nFor more specific documentation, see the module documentation for\n\"Options.Applicative.Helper\".";
