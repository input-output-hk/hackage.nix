For significant data sets,\nAWS Import/Export is often faster than Internet transfer and more cost\neffective than upgrading your connectivity.\n\n/See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/DG/api-reference.html AWS API Reference>\n\n/Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under\nheavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!";
