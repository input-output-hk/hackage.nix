      description = "\nWumpus - (W)riter (M)onad (P)ost (S)cript.\n\nWumpus is a kernel library for generating 2D vector pictures,\nits salient feature is portability due to no FFI dependencies.\nIt can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG files. The\ngenerated PostScript code is plain [1] and reasonably\nefficient as the use of stack operations, i.e @gsave@ and\n@grestore@, is minimized.\n\nPictures in Wumpus are made from /paths/ and text /labels/.\nPaths themselves are made from points. The usual affine\ntransformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be\napplied to geometric objects. Unlike PostScript there is no\nnotion of a current point, Wumpus builds pictures in a\ncoordinate-free style.\n\nGENERAL DRAWBACKS...\n\nFor actually drawing pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus is very\nlow level. There is a supplemantary package @wumpus-basic@\navailable that helps create certain types of diagram, but even\nthis lacks the higher-level stuff (polygons, arrows etc.) that\nwould make creating general drawings easy.\n\nSome of the design decisions made for wumpus-core are not\nsophisticated (e.g. how attributes like colour are handled,\nand how the bounding boxes of text labels are calculated), so\nWumpus might be limited compared to other systems. However,\nthe design permits a fairly simple implementation - which is\na priority. Text encoding an exception - I\\'m not sure how\nreasonable the design is. The current implementation\nappears okay for Latin 1 but may be inadequate for other\ncharacter sets, so I may have to revise it significantly.\n\nWARNING...\n\nThe module @Core.BoundingBox@ is likely to be reworked\nsignificantly in the future. It has too many functions that do\nnot offer distinct functionality. Some functions were removed in\nrevision 0.17.0 and some more are likely to follow.\n\n\n\\[1\\] Because the output is simple, straight-line PostScript\ncode, it is possible to use GraphicsMagick or a similar tool\nto convert Wumpus'\\s EPS files to many other formats\n(bitmaps).\n\nChangelog:\n\n0.22.0 TO 0.23.0:\n\n* @Basic.GraphicsState@ - extracted the font face fields from\n@FontAttr@ datatype into a separate datatype @FontFace@.\n\n* Added @PtSize@ a numeric type wrapping Double. This is\nspecifically for text size calculations, vis the\n@Core.FontSize@ module.\n\n* Changed all functions in @Core.FontSize@ to return @PtSize@\ninstead of a polymorphic type @u@ (where @u@ is an instance\nof Fractional). To get to another unit type rather than\nFontSize use an explicit conversion that scales the value\naccordingly.\n\n* Added FromPtSize class constraints to various functions in\n@Core.Picture@.\n\n* Added @charWidth@ to @Core.FontSize@.\n\n* Added @vlength@ to @Core.Geometry@\n\n";
