      description = "A package for convenient access to high-resolution\nclock and timer functions of different operating\nsystems.\n\nIt is planned to consist of two layers. The lower\nlayer will provide direct access to OS-specific\nclock and timer functions like clock_gettime of\nPosix or GetTickCount of Windows and its upper\nlayer shall then provide a common API for all\nsupported systems. Currently only the lower level\nis being developed.\n\n\nPOSIX reference: IEEE Std 1003.1-2008\n<http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/>,\n<http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/clock_getres.html#>\n\nWINDOWS reference: !! This early version is\nposix-only and does not build on Windows. Support\nwill be added in the future. !!\n\nFor more information, see:\n<http://sert.homedns.org/hs/clock>";
