      description = "A <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function perfect hash function> for a set @S@ is a hash function that maps distinct elements in @S@ to a set of integers, with __no collisions__. A <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function#Minimal_perfect_hash_function minimal perfect hash function> is a perfect hash function that maps @n@ keys to @n@ __consecutive__ integers, e.g. the numbers from @0@ to @n-1@.\n\nIn contrast with the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/PerfectHash PerfectHash package>, which is a binding to a C-based library, this package is a fully-native Haskell implementation.\n\nIt is intended primarily for generating C code for embedded applications (compare to @<https://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/manual/gperf.html#Search-Structures gperf>@). The output of this tool is a pair of arrays that can be included in generated C code for __<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_dynamic_memory_allocation allocation>-free hash tables__.\n\nThough lookups also perform reasonably well for Haskell applications, it hasn't been benchmarked thorougly with respect to other data structures.\n\nThis implementation was adapted from <http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=119 Steve Hanov's Blog>.\n\n= Usage\nThe library is written generically to hash both strings and raw integers according to the <http://isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/fnv/ FNV-1a algorithm>. Integers are split by octets before hashing.\n\n> import Data.PerfectHash.Construction (createMinimalPerfectHash)\n>\n> tuples = [\n>    (1000, 1)\n>  , (5555, 2)\n>  , (9876, 3)\n>  ]\n>\n> lookup_table = createMinimalPerfectHash tuples\n\nGeneration of C code based on the arrays in @lookup_table@ is left as an exercise to the reader. Algorithm documentation in the \"Data.PerfectHash.Hashing\" and \"Data.PerfectHash.Lookup\" modules will be helpful.\n\nSee the @hash-perfectly-strings-demo@ and @hash-perfectly-ints-demo@, as well as the test suite, for working examples.\n\n> \$ stack build\n> \$ stack exec hash-perfectly-strings-demo";
