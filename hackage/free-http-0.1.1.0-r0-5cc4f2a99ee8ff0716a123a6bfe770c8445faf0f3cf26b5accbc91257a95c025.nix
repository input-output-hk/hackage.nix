      description = "`free-http` is an http-client based on Free Monads.\n`free-http` exposes a Free Monad to express standard http\nverbs as well as several backends to interpet programs\nwritten in the free monad using various http clients\n(currently: a pure client, an `http-client`-backed client,\nand a random client).\nTo use free-http, simply:\n1. Import Network.HTTP.Client.Free to use the library.\n2. Choose your base request type by defining your own\ninstance of the `RequestType` type family or importing\none from an interpreter. E.g.\ndata MyClient\ntype instance RequestType MyClient = Request\n(or)\nimport Network.HTTP.Free.Client.HttpClient (HttpClient)\n3. Choose your base response type by defining your own\ninstance of the `ResponseTYpe` type family or importing\none from an interpreter. E.g.\ntype instance ResponseType MyClient = Response ByteString\n(or)\nimport Network.HTTP.Free.Client.HttpClient (HttpClient)\n4. Write a program in the 'FreeHttp MyClient m a' free monad.\n5. Import an interpreter, such as 'HttpClient'\nimport Network.HTTP.Free.Client.HttpClient\n6. Run your program against the interpreter:\nrunHttp (myProgram :: FreeHttp MyClient IO String)";
