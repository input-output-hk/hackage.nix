This expressive power\nis highly useful in a wide range of areas, including text parsing\nand XML processing. Regular expression patterns in HaRP work over\nordinary Haskell lists ([]) of arbitrary type. We have implemented\nHaRP as a pre-processor to ordinary Haskell.\n\nFor details on usage, please see the website.";
