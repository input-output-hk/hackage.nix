      description = "\nNoSlow is a benchmark suite for several Haskell array libraries:\nstandard lists, primitive sequential arrays from the DPH project,\nuvector, vector (primitive, storable and boxed arrays) and\nstorablevector. At the moment, it implements a bunch of fairly random\nloop micro-kernels but will include many more benchmarks in the future.\n\nIn its present state, NoSlow /cannot/ be used to reliably compare the\nperformance of the benchmarked libraries. It can be quite helpful for\nidentifying cases where a closer inspection of the generated code\nmight be warranted, however.\n\nThe package builds two binaries.\n\n[@noslow -u log@] runs the benchmarks and writes the results to 'log'\n\n[@noslow-table log > table.html@] outputs the results as a HTML table.\nIt also supports the following options.\n\n[@noslow-table log --type=Double@] only outputs the results of 'Double'\nbenchmarks.\n\n[@noslow-table --diff log1 log2@] produces a table comparing the\nresults from 'log1' and 'log2' (2 means the first run was 2x slower\nthan the second; 0.5 means 2x faster).\n\nNoSlow is described in more detail here:\n<http://unlines.wordpress.com/2009/11/27/noslow/>.\n";
