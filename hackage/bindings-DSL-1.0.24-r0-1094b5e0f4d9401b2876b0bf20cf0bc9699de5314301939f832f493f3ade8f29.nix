All Haskell names used are automatically\nderived from C names, structures are mapped to Haskell instances\nof Storable, and there are also macros you can use with C code\nto help write bindings to inline functions or macro functions.\nDocumentation is available at package homepage:\n\n<https://github.com/jwiegley/bindings-dsl/wiki>\n\nThe extra module Bindings.Utilities will contain tools that may\nbe convenient when working with FFI.";
