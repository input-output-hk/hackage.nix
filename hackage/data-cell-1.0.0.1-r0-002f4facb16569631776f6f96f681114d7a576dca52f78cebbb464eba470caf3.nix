In addition, in order\nto achieve truly-constant memory usage irrespective of\nindividual cell size, we allow individual cells to be\nsubdivided further into /parts/, as indicated by the\n/end of part/ condition. Logically, this subdivision\ninto parts is supposed to be purely operational and\nhave no semantic significance, similarly to subdivision\nof lazy bytestrings into chunks.";
