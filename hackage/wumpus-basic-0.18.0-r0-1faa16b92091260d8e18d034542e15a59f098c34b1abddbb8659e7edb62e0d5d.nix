This\npackage provides font loader code (currently limited to AFM font\nfiles) and a various /drawing objects/ intended to be a\nhigher-level basis to make vector drawings than the primitives\n(paths, text labels) provided by Wumpus-Core.\n\n\\*\\* WARNING \\*\\* - this package is alpha grade and it is\nstrongly coupled to the package @Wumpus-Drawing@ which is\nsub-alpha grade. The packages are split as it is expected they\nwill have different development speeds - @Wumpus-Basic@ needs\npolishing and refinement; @Wumpus-Drawing@ simply needs a lot of\nwork to move its components from /proof-of-concept/ ideas to\nbeing readily usable.\n\n\nNOTE - the demos that were previously included are now in the\npackage @Wumpus-Drawing@.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\nv0.17.0 to v0.18.0:\n\n* Major change - removed @ContextFun@ from @Kernel.Base@. Now\nthe drawing objects (Image, LocImage, Connector...) are\nnewtype wrapped Reader-Writer monads rather than aliases to\none of the arity family of ContextFuns. Being newtypes gives\na lot better opportunities for overloading.\n\n* Changed Displacement API - it is smaller, and the function\nnaming is more uniform.\n\n* Changed @DrawingPimitives@ to use @DrawStyle@.\n\n* Moved vertices generating functions from @Geometry.Path@ to\n@Geometry.Vertices@.\n";
