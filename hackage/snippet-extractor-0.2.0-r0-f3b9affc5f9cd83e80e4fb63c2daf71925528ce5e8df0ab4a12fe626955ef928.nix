If the desired filename\ncontains spaces, put the filename in quotes.\n\nEverything on the line with the start and end\nmarkers is discarded.  Snippet-extractor should\nbe agnostic to the syntax of the file you are\nextracting from.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n>  /* @snippet-start snippet1.c */\n>  for(i = 0; i < 100; i++){\n>    printf(\"%d\\n\",i);\n>  }\n>  /* @snippet-end */\n\nThe above snippet would be extracted and placed in\nsnippet1.c\n\nSnippet-extractor is intended for use in\ndocumentation.  For example, the snippets could\nbe extracted from working code and then included\nin a text about the code.";
