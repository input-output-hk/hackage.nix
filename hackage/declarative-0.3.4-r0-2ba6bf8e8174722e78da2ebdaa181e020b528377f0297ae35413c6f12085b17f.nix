      description = "This package presents a simple combinator language for Markov transition\noperators that are useful in MCMC.\n\nAny transition operators sharing the same stationary distribution and obeying\nthe Markov and reversibility properties can be combined in a couple of ways,\nsuch that the resulting operator preserves the stationary distribution and\ndesirable properties amenable for MCMC.\n\nWe can deterministically concatenate operators end-to-end, or sample from\na collection of them according to some probability distribution.  See\n<http://www.stat.umn.edu/geyer/f05/8931/n1998.pdf Geyer, 2005> for details.\n\nA useful strategy is to hedge one's 'sampling risk' by occasionally\ninterleaving a computationally-expensive transition (such as a gradient-based\nalgorithm like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo or NUTS) with cheap Metropolis\ntransitions.\n\n> transition = frequency [\n>     (9, metropolis 1.0)\n>   , (1, hamiltonian 0.05 20)\n>   ]\n\nAlternatively: sample consecutively using the same algorithm, but over a\nrange of different proposal distributions.\n\n> transition = concatAllT [\n>     slice 0.5\n>   , slice 1.0\n>   , slice 2.0\n>   ]\n\nOr just mix and match and see what happens!\n\n> transition =\n>   sampleT\n>     (sampleT (metropolis 0.5) (slice 0.1))\n>     (sampleT (hamiltonian 0.01 20) (metropolis 2.0))\n\nCheck the test suite for example usage.";
