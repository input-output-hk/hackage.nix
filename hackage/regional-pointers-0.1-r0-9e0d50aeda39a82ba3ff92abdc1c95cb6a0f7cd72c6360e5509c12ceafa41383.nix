Most importantly, a pointer can't be\nreturned from the region. So it's impossible to reference\nunallocated memory.\n\nThe primary technique used in this package is called \\\"Lightweight\nmonadic regions\\\" which was invented by Oleg Kiselyov and\nChung-chieh Shan. See:\n\n<http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/regions.html#light-weight>\n\nThis technique is implemented in the @regions@ package which is\nre-exported from this library.\n\nThis library provides wrappers around all the @Ptr@ functions\nfrom the @Foreign.*@ modules from @base@.";
