You give it a possibly-misspelled word,\nand it spits out one or more properly-spelled words in order\nof likelihood of similarity.\n\nThe latest change to the implementation is an addition\nof an optional precompiled SQlite database of phonetic\ncodes for the entire dictionary, created with\n\"thimk-makedb\".  This greatly speeds lookup, permitting\nreasonable performance on enormous dictionaries.";
