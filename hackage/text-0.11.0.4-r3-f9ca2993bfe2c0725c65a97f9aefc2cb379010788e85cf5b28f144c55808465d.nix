This package provides text processing\ncapabilities that are optimized for performance critical use, both\nin terms of large data quantities and high speed.\n\nThe 'Text' type provides character-encoding, type-safe case\nconversion via whole-string case conversion functions. It also\nprovides a range of functions for converting 'Text' values to and from\n'ByteStrings', using several standard encodings.\n\nEfficient locale-sensitive support for text IO is also supported.\n\nThese modules are intended to be imported qualified, to avoid name\nclashes with Prelude functions, e.g.\n\n> import qualified Data.Text as T\n\nTo use an extended and very rich family of functions for working\nwith Unicode text (including normalization, regular expressions,\nnon-standard encodings, text breaking, and locales), see\nthe @text-icu@ package:\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-icu>\n";
