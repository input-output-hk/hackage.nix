      description = "Data.Map.Vector provides @MapVector@, a wrapper around @Map@ from @containers@ which supports constant maps, i.e. maps containing only one value.  This allows an identity under intersection and an @Applicative@ instance.  It also has instances of @AdditiveGroup@, @VectorSpace@, @InnerSpace@, and @HasBasis@ with appropriate value types.  Provides operations for addition, subtraction, element-wise operations (through @Applicative@), scalar multiplication (through @VectorSpace@), and dot product.  Also consider Conal Elliott's @total-map@ package.";
