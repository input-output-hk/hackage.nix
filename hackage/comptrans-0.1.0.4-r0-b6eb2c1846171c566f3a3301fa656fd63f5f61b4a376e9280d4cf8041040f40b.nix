You might need to add additional constructors that can e.g.: convert a (Term e Foo) into a\n(Term e [Foo]).\n\nThe sCource files have comments showing example output for a simple language. See the examples directory\nfor an extended example of generating a compositional data type for the entire Java language, with labelled variants\nas well as variants where an entire project of source files can be treated as a single AST -- and you can use the same operations\non all of them!";
