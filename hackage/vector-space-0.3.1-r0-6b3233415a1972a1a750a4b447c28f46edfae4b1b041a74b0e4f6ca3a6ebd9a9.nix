A generalized derivative is a linear\ntransformation rather than one of the common concrete representations\n(scalars, vectors, matrices, ...).\n\n'''Warning''': this package depends on type families working fairly well,\nand requires ghc version at least 6.9.\n\nProject wiki page: <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/vector-space>\n\nThe module documentation pages have links to colorized source code and\nto wiki pages where you can read and contribute user comments.
