The\n@Par@ monad family, as defined in\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/abstract-par/docs/Control-Monad-Par-Class.html abstract-par>\nprovides deterministic parallelism, but sometimes we can tolerate a\nbit of nondeterminism.\n\nThis package builds on the\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/concurrency concurrency>\npackage by enabling you to systematically and deterministically test\nyour concurrent programs.";
