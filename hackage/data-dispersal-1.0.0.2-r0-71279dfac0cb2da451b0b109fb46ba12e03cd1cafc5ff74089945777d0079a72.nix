However, the knowledge of 1 or more fragments might\nallow an adversary to deduce some information about the original data.\nThe module @Crypto.IDA@ combines information dispersal with\nsecret sharing: the knowledge of up to @m-1@ fragments does not leak any\ninformation about the original data.\n\nThis could be useful in scenarios where we need to store data at untrusted\nstorage sites: To this end, we store one encrypted fragment at each site.\nIf at most @m-1@ of these untrusted sites collude, they will still\nbe unable to obtain any information about the original data.\nThe added security comes at the price of a slightly\nincreased fragment size (by an additional constant 32 bytes) and an\nadditional overhead in the running time of the encoding/decoding process.\nThe algorithm is fully described in module \"Crypto.IDA\".\n\n/Fault-Tolerance:/\n\nSuppose that we have @N@ machines and encode our data as @2log(N)@ fragments\nwith reconstruction threshold m = @log(N)@.\nLet's assume that we store each fragment on a separate machine and each\nmachine fails (independently) with probability at most 0.5.\n\n* What is the probability of our data being safe?\n@Pr[ at most n-m machines crash ] >= 1-0.5^(log(N)) = 1-N^(-1).@\n\n* What is the overhead in terms of space that we pay for this level of fault-tolerance?\nWe have n fragments, each of size @O(D\\/m)@, so the total space is @O(n D\\/ m) =\n2D.@\nIn other words, we can guarantee that the data survives with high probability\nby increasing the required space by a constant factor.\n\nThis library is based on the following works:\n\n* \\\"Efficient Dispersal of\nInformation for Security, Load Balancing, and Fault Tolerance\\\", by Michael O.\nRabin, JACM 1989.\n\n* \\\"How to share a secret.\\\" by Adi Shamir.\nIn Communications of the ACM 22 (11): 612â€“613, 1979.\n\n* \\\"Secret Sharing Made Short\\\" Hugo Krawczyk.\nCRYPTO 1993: 136-146";
