      description = "\n\\*\\* WARNING \\*\\* - this package is sub-alpha. Although many of\nthe drawing objects have been improved since the code was split\nfrom Wumpus-Basic, the code is still prototypical. Essentially\nthis package is a /technology preview/ and not yet a re-usable\nlibrary.\n\nNOTE - many of the demos use font metrics. Font metrics for\nthe \\\"Core 14\\\" PostScript fonts are distributed as @*.afm@\nfiles with GhostScript in the @fonts@ directory. Wumpus expects\nthe GhostScript font metrics to be AFM version 2.0 files (this\nmatches GhostScript 8.63). Alternatively, metrics for the Core\n14 fonts are available from Adode (AFM version 4.1), see the\nlinks below. To run the demos properly you will need one of\nthese sets of metrics.\n\nAdobe Font technical notes:\n<https://www.adobe.com/devnet/font.html>\n\nCore 14 AFM metrics:\n<https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/font/pdfs/Core14_AFMs.tar>\n\nAlso note that Wumpus uses fallback metrics (derived from the\nmonospaced Courier font) when font loading fails, rather than\nthrowing a terminal error. Applications should ideally check\nthe font loading log to ensure that fonts have loaded correctly\n(the demos print this log to standard out).\n\nChangelog:\n\nv0.3.0 to v0.4.0:\n\n* Simplified Trapezium shape so it only produces isosceles\nTrapeziums.\n\n* Added Basis modules. These are \\\"mid-level\\\" modules similar\nto ones in @Wumpus.Basic.Kernel.Objects@, however they are\nconsidered less general so there are put here where they can\nbe imported individually (and so not pollute the namespace).\n\n* Removed the Turtle modules. The new @LocTrace@ and @RefTrace@\nmodules supercede the Turtle modules.\n\n";
