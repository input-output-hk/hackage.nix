There is also an interface which is agnostic of the underlying\nstring type.\n\n[@v1.0.2@] Fixed an issue with @strSplitAll@. Applied to the empty string\nit should return an empty list, but it returned a list containing\na single empty string. It now returns correctly the empty list.\n\n[@v1.1@] Added @strToUpper@, @strToLower@, @strCapitalize@, @strCons@,\nand  @strMap@. Also @sCapitalize@, @sCons@, and @sMap@.";
