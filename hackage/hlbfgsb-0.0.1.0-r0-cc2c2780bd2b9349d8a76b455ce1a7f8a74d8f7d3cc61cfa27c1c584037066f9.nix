So far no support for limiting iteration\ncount. A more powerful interface should be developed.\n\nNotice: The fortran code is marked pure, althugh it tends to write\nto standard output at troubled times (should be fixed at some point in time).\n\nFrom homepage:\nSoftware for Large-scale Bound-constrained Optimization L-BFGS-B is a\nlimited-memory quasi-Newton code for bound-constrained optimization, i.e.\nfor problems where the only constraints are of the form l <= x <= u. The\ncurrent release is version 3.0. The distribution file was last changed on\n2011-08-02.";
