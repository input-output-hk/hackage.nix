Once built, other packages can query this\ninformation without needing to do complex trickery themselves.\n\nSee also the included @ReadMe.xhtml@ file.\n\nChanges:\n\n* If the configure step fails to detect the OS type, the configure\nstep now /fails/.\n\n* A new file @Manual.hs@ allows you to override the\nauto-detected platform values with whatever you want. (See\n@ReadMe.xhtml@ for details.)\n\n* All the platform queries no longer return @Maybe@ values. (This\nbreaks API compatibility, hence the version bump.)";
