Thus, the reactive-banana library promises to avoid the spagethetti code commonly used in traditional GUI technologies.\n\nSee the project homepage <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Reactive-banana>\nfor a more detailed introduction and features.\n\nStability forecast:\nNo semantic bugs expected.\nSignificant API changes are likely in future versions,\nthough the main interface is beginning to stabilize.";
