      description = "Haskell bindings to the CasADi algorithmic differentiation and optimal control library.\nVersion numbers correspond to the C++ library version numbers except the very last number\nwhich may indicate breaking changes.\n\nThis is a metapackage which also hosts the installation instructions. The purpose is that\nusers of the library will always be able to \"cabal install casadi-bindings\" and have things\nJust Work, though you may need to install additional add-on modules manually.\n\nThe `casadi-bindings-internal` package is handwritten and provides some casadi memory management\nwrappers and C++ standard type marsahalling.\n\nThe rest of the modules like `casadi-bindings-core`, `casadi-bindings-ipopt-interface`, etc\nare autogenerated from casadi's swig interface and correspond exactly to the casadi C++ API.\n\nFor high-level bindings, see my <https://github.com/ghorn/dynobud dynobud> project\n\nThe current instructions for getting started on Debian/Ubuntu:\n\nInstall libcasadi-shared from <https://github.com/casadi/casadi/releases/latest https://github.com/casadi/casadi/releases/latest>,\nfirst download it from that website, then:\n\n>> dpkg -i libcasadi-shared.deb\n\n>> cabal update; cabal install casadi-bindings\n\nto install the ipopt interface:\n\n>> apt-get install coinor-libipopt-dev\n\n>> cabal install casadi-bindings-ipopt-interface\n\nTemporary note: there is something wrong with casadi and ipopt related\nto <http://list.coin-or.org/pipermail/ipopt/2014-April/003670.html http://list.coin-or.org/pipermail/ipopt/2014-April/003670.html>,\nand <https://github.com/casadi/casadi/issues/1075 https://github.com/casadi/casadi/issues/1075>.\nAt the moment this .cabal package works for me as is, but YMMV\n\nFor the snopt interface, you may have to do something like\n\n> cabal install casadi-bindings-snopt-interface --extra-libs-dir='/home/me/snopt/lib'\n\nto find the snopt libraries\n\nI only officially support debian/ubuntu right now, but I have gotten it working on OSX\nin the past. Everything is done with pkg-config and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so there's no reason\nI know that there should be problems.";
