      description = "/Warning/: This software is pre 1.0 and thus its API may change very\ndynamically while updating only minor versions. This package will follow the\nPVP once it reaches version 1.0.\n\nOAuth is a popular protocol allowing servers to offer resources owned by some\nuser to a series of authorized clients securely. For instance, OAuth lets\nTwitter provide access to a user's private tweets to the Twitter client\nregistered on their phone.\n\n@oauthenticated@ is a Haskell library implementing OAuth protocols atop the\nminimalistic @http-client@ HTTP client library extracted from @http-conduit@.\nIt offers a simplified main API in \"Network.OAuth\" which provides simplistic,\nauthenticated @GET@ and @POST@ requests atop OAuth using a trivial state\nmonad. It also offers a lower-level API in \"Network.OAuth.Signing\" which can\nbe used to sign arbitrary requests while intercepting and modifying the OAuth\nparameter set.\n\nThere's also an implementation of OAuth's three-legged credential acquisition\nprotocol built atop the \"Network.OAuth\" API. This can be handled in both\nconformant and old-style modes: conformant will reject server responses which\nare not conformant with RFC 5849 (which builds atop community version OAuth\n1.0a) while old-style better allows for less-than-compliant servers. See\n'Network.OAuth.Types.Params.Version' for more details.\n\nCurrently @oauthenticated@ only supports OAuth 1.0 and is in alpha. OAuth 2.0\nsupport is a potential goal, but it's unclear if it can be transparently\nsupported at a similar level of abstraction.";
