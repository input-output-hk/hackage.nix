In addition to this we even  provide a monadic interface.\nParsers do analyse themselves to avoid commonly made errors\n\nThe file \"Text.ParserCombinators.UU.Examples\" contains a ready-made main function,\nwhich can be called to see the error correction at work. It contains extensive haddock documentation;\ntry all the small tests for yourself to see the correction process at work, and to get a\nfeeling for how to use the various combinators.\n\nThe file \"Text.ParserCombinators.UU.Changelog\" contains a log of the most recent changes and additions\n\nThe file \"Text.ParserCombinators.UU.README\" contains some references to background information\n";
