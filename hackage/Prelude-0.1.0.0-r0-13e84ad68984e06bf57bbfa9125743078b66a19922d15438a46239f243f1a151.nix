      description = "This package provides a \"Prelude\" module drop-in replacement for [base](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base)'s @Prelude@ module.\n\nGoals of this package include:\n\n* Be reasonably modest and remain close in spirit to the @base@ package's scope\n\n* Depend only on @base@ (via @base-noprelude@) for recent GHC versions\n\n* Avoid partial functions being in scope by default; redefine common partial functions such as @read@ or @head@ to be 'Maybe'-valued\n\n* Provide a uniform \"Prelude\" across multiple GHC releases (currently GHC 7.0 and newer supported) to the extent possible given typeclass restructurings such as AMP or FTP\n\n* Reduce @import@ clutter by reexporting common verbs from modules such as @Control.Monad@ and @Control.Applicative@\n\n=== Versioning and Usage\n\nThis package is intended to be used in combination with [base-noprelude](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-noprelude) and\npossibly [base-orphans](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-orphans). @Prelude@ strives to be faithful to\nthe [PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org/); however, for technical reasons @Prelude@'s API is not fully determined by its version due to changes in core typeclasses and consequently it's strongly advised to declare a dependency on @Prelude@ always in conjunction with a dependency on @base-noprelude@.\n\nFor instance, all you need to do in order to use this package if you were previously depending on [base](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base) via\n\n> build-depends:\n>     base ^>= 4.10.0.0 || ^>= 4.11.0.0\n\nis to replace @base@ by @base-noprelude@ and also add a dependency on @Prelude@ like so\n\n> build-depends:\n>     Prelude ^>= 0.1.0.0\n>   , base-noprelude ^>= 4.10.0.0 || ^>= 4.11.0.0\n\nand this will effectively replace the implicit \"Prelude\" module.";
