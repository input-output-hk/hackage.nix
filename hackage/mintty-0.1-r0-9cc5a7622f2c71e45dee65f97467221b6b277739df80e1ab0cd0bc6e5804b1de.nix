      description = "MinTTY is a Windows-specific terminal emulator for the\nwidely used Cygwin and MSYS projects, which provide\nUnix-like environments for Windows. MinTTY consoles behave\ndifferently from native Windows consoles (such as\n@cmd.exe@ or PowerShell) in many ways, and in some cases,\nthese differences make it necessary to treat MinTTY\nconsoles differently in code.\n\nThe @mintty@ library provides a simple way to detect if\nyour code in running in a MinTTY console on Windows. It\nexports @isMinTTY@, which does the right thing 90% of the\ntime (by checking if standard error is attached to\nMinTTY), and it also exports @isMinTTYHandle@ for the\nother 10% of the time (when you want to check is some\narbitrary handle is attached to MinTTY). As you might\nexpect, both of these functions will simply return @False@\non any non-Windows operating system.";
