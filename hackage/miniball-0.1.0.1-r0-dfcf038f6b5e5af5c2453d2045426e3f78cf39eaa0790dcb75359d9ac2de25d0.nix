It consists of only\na header file, and can be retrieved from <http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/gaertner/miniball.html>.\nTo build this package, simply have @miniball.hpp@ in GCC's include path. The standard C++ library\nand GCC with C++ support are also needed.\n\nMiniball itself is copyright 1999-2013, Bernd Gärtner.\n\nThe current version has only been tested with version 3.0 of Miniball.\n\nChanges in version 0.1.0.1:\n\n* Fix grave allocation bug.";
