For example, if\nyou define an ontology under namespace @hello@, you can place vocabulary\nentities under @Data.Smaoin.Vocabulary.Hello@.\n\nVocabulary entity modules should be auto-generated from their source\ndocuments (mostly written in <http://rel4tion.org/projects/idan Idan>), but\nat this early stage the variable definitions in this package are written\nmanually (but based on the Idan sources).\n\nFor more information, see the project homepage.";
