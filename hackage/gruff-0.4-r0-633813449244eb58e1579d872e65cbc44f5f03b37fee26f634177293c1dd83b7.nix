      description = "Mandelbrot Set fractal explorer using the ruff library.\n\nRequires GTK, OpenGL, and GLSL fragment shader support; lots of RAM\nand multiple CPU cores recommended.\n\nIf you want to explore very deep zooms, you'll need hmpfr which\ncurrently requires GHC to be compiled with integer-simple instead of\nthe default integer-gmp.  To install with MPFR support, use\n@cabal install gruff -fmpfr@.\nNote that the default setting for this flag has changed since gruff-0.2.\n\ngruff-0.4 updates for ghc-8.0.\n\ngruff-0.3.4 updates dependencies for ghc-7.8.  Colouring is improved.\n\ngruff-0.3.3 relaxes dependencies for ghc-7.6.\n\ngruff-0.3.1 is a bugfix release, fixing a performance problem wherein\noffscreen tiles were needlessly calculated.  The performance gain\nis much less (and in many cases is in fact a performance loss) when\nusing integer-simple.\n\ngruff-0.3 includes a small library to allow external programs to\ncreate diagrams and animations with gruff.  See the gruff-examples\npackage.  The interface has been remodelled to simplify it and add\ninformative feature overlays.\n\ngruff-0.2.1 was a bugfix release.  Changes since gruff-0.2:\n\n* Supersampling bugs are fixed (no more undocumented quantization\nleading to inconsistent appearance at different zoom levels).\n\n* Race condition bugs in cache management are fixed (no more\nincompletely rendered images).\n\n* Internal changes/refactoring to make future additions easier.\n\nFeatures in this version include:\n\n* Interactive fractal browser display with mouse controls:\n\n* Left click to zoom in (press shift for bigger jumps).\n\n* Right click to zoom out (press shift for bigger jumps).\n\n* Middle click to center.\n\n* Shift middle click to auto-focus.\n\n* Control left click to label with period.\n\n* Control right click to label with angled internal address (slow!).\n\n* Session persistance (stored in @~\\/.gruff\\/state.gruff@ - states can\nalso be loaded from and saved to other files, including labels and\nrays).  Note that the file format is incompatible with previous\nreleases of gruff.\n\n* Tile cache (by default in @~\\/.gruff\\/cache@ - symlink it somewhere\nwith a few GB of space if you plan on exploring a lot).\n\n* Can use MPFR if desired for higher precision, allowing deeper\nzooms and locating high period nucleii.\n\n* Limited amount of customizable colouring (colours for interior,\nborder, and exterior points, as well as labels and rays).\n\n* Supersampling for more detailed images (useful range is 1 to 16).\n\n* Rudimentary scripting support (see the gruff-examples package).\n\nFuture versions will focus on enhancing the scripting support.";
