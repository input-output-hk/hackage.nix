It\nis based on the decNumber C library, which is available\nat\n\n<http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decnumber.html>\n\ndecNumber, in turn, implements the General Decimal Arithmetic\nSpecification, which is available at\n\n<http://speleotrove.com/decimal/>\n\nTo use deka, you will first need to install the decNumber\nC library.  To make this easy for users of UNIX-like operating\nsystems, I have packaged decNumber; the package is at\n\n<https://github.com/massysett/decnumber/releases>\n\nFor more on deka, please see the Github home page at\n\n<https://github.com/massysett/deka>";
