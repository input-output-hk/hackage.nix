I also\nthought this is a great chance for people to quickly see their code in real\nuse, which is motivating when learning programming, and it's a chance to\nintroduce Haskell to the community.\n\nThis library powers FunBot (which at the time of writing runs under the\nnickname /fpbot/ in Freenode) and its development is therefore driven by\nactual bot needs.";
