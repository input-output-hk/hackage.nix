      description = "Based off of the paper \\\"A Pattern for Almost Homomorphic Functions\\\"\nat <http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~nfrisby/frisby-wgp-2012.pdf>, presented at the\nWorkshop on Generic Programming 2012. Also, my\ndissertation <http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~nfrisby/frisby-dissertation.pdf>\n\n@yoko@ views a nominal datatype as a /band/ of constructors, each\na nominal type in its own right. Such datatypes can be disbanded via the\n@disband@ function into an anonymous sum of nominal constructors, and vice\nversa via the @band@ function. This library uses extensive type-level\nprogramming to enrich its @instant-generics@ foundation with capabilities\nderived from the constructor-centric perspective.\n\nFor example, consider the following /nominal datatype/.\n\n@\ndata Beatles = John ... | Paul ... | George ... | Ringo ...\n@\n\nThis type can of course be understood as a sum of the individual\n/fields types/.\n\n@\ndata John   = John   ...\ndata Paul   = Paul   ...\ndata George = George ...\ndata Ringo  = Ringo  ...\n@\n\n@yoko@'s conceptual foundations start there. In particular, this allows a\nconstructor, say @John@, to be used independently of its original range type\nand sibling constructors.\n\nAs a generic programming library, @yoko@ extends @instant-generics@ with\nsupport for constructor-centric generic programming. The\n@Examples\\/LambdaLift\\/LambdaLift.hs@ file distributed with the @yoko@ source\ndemonstrates defining a lambda-lifting conversion between the two types\n@ULC@, which has lambdas, and @Prog@, which has top-level function\ndeclarations instead.\n\n@\ndata ULC = Lam Type ULC | Var Int | Let [Decl] ULC | App ULC ULC\n\ndata Decl = Decl Type ULC\n\n\n\ndata Prog = Prog [FunDec] TLF\ntype FunDec = ([Type], [Type], Type, TLF)\n\ndata TLF = Top Int [Occ] | Occ Occ | App TLF TLF\ndata Occ = Par Int | Env Int\n@\n\nThese types are defined in separate modules, since they have constructors\nwith the same name. Indeed, the fact that they having matching constructors\nnamed @App@ is crucial for @yoko@'s automatic conversion from @ULC@'s @App@\nto @TLF@'s @App@. As written, the generic lambda-lifter would continue to\nwork for any new @ULC@ constructors (e.g. syntax for tuples or mutable\nreferences) as long as constructors with the same names and analogous fields\nwere added to @TLF@ and the semantics of those constructors doesn't involve\nbinding. This default /generic/ behavior of the lambda-lifter is specified in\nabout ten lines of user code.\n\nThe non-generic code is much more complicated. This is intentional: I wanted\nto show that sometimes shoehorning an algorithm into the requisite type (/ie/\n@a -> m a'@) can be difficult and require subtleties like backwards state.\n\nExisting generic libraries don't use constructor names to the degree that\n@yoko@ does, and so cannot accomodate generic /conversions/ as well.";
