The aim is both type-safety and convenience of use for\nHaskell users, combined with high performance and minimal memory footprint\nby taking advantage of Haskell's laziness and the conduit library's\ndeterministic resource cleanup.\n\nFor further information, as well as typical use cases, see \"Git.Tutorial\".";
