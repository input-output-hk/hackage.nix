      description = "CmdTheLine aims to remove tedium from the definition of command-line\nprograms, producing usage, help and man pages with little effort.\n\nThe inspiration was found in Daniel Bunzli's\n<http://erratique.ch/software/cmdliner> library.\n\nCmdTheLine uses applicative functors to provide a declarative, compositional\nmechanism for defining command-line programs by lifting regular Haskell\nfunctions over argument parsers.\n\nSuggestions, comments, and bug reports are appreciated. Please see the\nbug and issue tracker at <http://github.com/eli-frey/cmdtheline>.\n\nChanges since 0.1:\n\n* More type safety: Types in CmdTheLine.Arg have been made more explicit to\ndisalow unwanted behavior.  Positional argument information and optional\nargument information are distinguished from each other.  As well 'Arg's must\nbe transformed into 'Term' before use, as some operations make since to\nperform on 'Arg' but not on 'Term'.\n\n* ArgVal has only one method: 'parser' and 'pp' have been fused into a tuple, so\nthat instantiation of 'ArgVal' can be simplified for all parties.\n\n* Err is an instance of MonadIO:  The 'Err' monad now supports IO action.\n\n* File and Directory path validation:  Taking advantage of new 'Err'\ncapabilities, the library provides new functions for validating 'String's\ninside of 'Term's as being valid\\/existent file\\/directory paths.";
