Towards this end, this module supplies a type of\n/combinable error messages/ so that all of the errors from subcomputations\ncan be gathered and presented together.\n\nNew in version 1.1:  Removed Monoid instance for Doc (it should now be supplied by ansi-wl-pprint), added ErrorMessageOr type alias.";
