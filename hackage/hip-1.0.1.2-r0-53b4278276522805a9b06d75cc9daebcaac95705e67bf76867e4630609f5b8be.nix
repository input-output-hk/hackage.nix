It is highly extendable, with an ability to add custom color spaces or use some other underlying data structure.\n\nIt is capable of reading and writing a number of popular image formats by using <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/JuicyPixels JuciyPixels> and <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/netpbm netpbm> packages. Being a pure Haskell library it does not require any external programs, although it can display images using a program of your choice.";
