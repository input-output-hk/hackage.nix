When a program is initialized, it:\n\n* Ensures that teardown sub-routines are executed /exactly/ once\n\n* Ensures that if errors occur on the execution of a Teardown sub-routine, the\nerror does not propagate to others; bulkheading failure on cleanup.\n\n* Requires every sub-routine to be documented at creation time; thus helping\ntracing your application structure.\n\n* Allows tracing the teardown of your application, how is structured, how much\ntime it takes to execute, and what component (if any) failed to finalize.";
