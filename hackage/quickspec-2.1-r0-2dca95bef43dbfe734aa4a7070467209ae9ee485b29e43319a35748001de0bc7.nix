      description = "QuickSpec takes your Haskell code and, as if by magic, discovers laws\nabout it. You give QuickSpec a collection of Haskell functions;\nQuickSpec tests your functions with QuickCheck and prints out laws which\nseem to hold.\n\nFor example, give QuickSpec the functions @reverse@, @++@ and @[]@, and\nit will find six laws:\n\n> reverse [] == []\n> xs ++ [] == xs\n> [] ++ xs == xs\n> reverse (reverse xs) == xs\n> (xs ++ ys) ++ zs == xs ++ (ys ++ zs)\n> reverse xs ++ reverse ys == reverse (ys ++ xs)\n\nQuickSpec can find equational laws as well as conditional equations. All\nyou need to supply are the functions to test, as well as @Ord@ and\n@Arbitrary@ instances for QuickSpec to use in testing; the rest is\nautomatic.\n\nFor information on how to use QuickSpec, see the documentation in the main\nmodule, \"QuickSpec\". You can also look in the\n@<https://github.com/nick8325/quickspec/tree/master/examples examples>@\ndirectory, for example at\n@<https://github.com/nick8325/quickspec/tree/master/examples/Lists.hs Lists.hs>@,\n@<https://github.com/nick8325/quickspec/tree/master/examples/IntSet.hs IntSet.hs>@, or\n@<https://github.com/nick8325/quickspec/tree/master/examples/Parsing.hs Parsing.hs>@.\nTo read about how\nQuickSpec works, see our paper,\n<http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nicsma/papers/quickspec2.pdf Quick specifications for the busy programmer>.";
