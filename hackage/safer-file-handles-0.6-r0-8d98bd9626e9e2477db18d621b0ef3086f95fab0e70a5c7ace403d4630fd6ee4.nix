      description = "This package adds two safety features on top of the regular\n@System.IO@ file handles and operations:\n\n* Regional file handles. Files must be opened in a /region/. When\nthe region terminates all opened files are automatically\nclosed. The main advantage of regions is that the handles to\nthe opened files can not be returned from the region which\nensures no I/O with closed files is possible.\n\n* Explicit IOModes. The regional file handles are parameterized\nby the IOMode in which they were opened. All operations on\nhandles explicitly specify the needed IOMode. This way it is\nimpossible to read from a write-only handle or write to a\nread-only handle for example.\n\nThe primary technique used in this package is called \\\"Lightweight\nmonadic regions\\\" which was invented by Oleg Kiselyov and\nChung-chieh Shan. See:\n\n<http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/regions.html#light-weight>\n\nThis technique is implemented in the @regions@ package which is\nre-exported from @safer-file-handles@.\n\nSee the @safer-file-handles-examples@ package for examples how\nto use this package:\n\n@darcs get <http://code.haskell.org/~basvandijk/code/safer-file-handles-examples>@\n\nSee the @safer-file-handles-bytestring@ package for @ByteString@\noperations on regional file handles.";
