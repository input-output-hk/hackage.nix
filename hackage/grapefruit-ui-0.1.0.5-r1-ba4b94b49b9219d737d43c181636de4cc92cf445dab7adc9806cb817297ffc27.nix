      description = "Grapefruit is a library for Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)\nwith a focus on user interfaces. FRP makes it possible to\nimplement reactive and interactive systems in a declarative\nstyle. To learn more about FRP, have a look at\n<http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Functional_Reactive_Programming>.\n\nThis package contains general user interface support. To make use\nof it, it has to be complemented by a UI backend. It is possible\nto have different UI backends implementing the same general\ninterface on top of different UI toolkits. At the moment, the\nonly backend is one based on GTK+. This is provided by the\ngrapefruit-ui-gtk package.";
