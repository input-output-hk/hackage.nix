This reference provides\ndescriptions of the operations and data types for AWS CodeCommit API.\nYou can use the AWS CodeCommit API to work with the following objects:\n-   Repositories, by calling the following:\n-   < BatchGetRepositories>, which returns information about one or\nmore repositories associated with your AWS account\n-   < CreateRepository>, which creates an AWS CodeCommit repository\n-   < DeleteRepository>, which deletes an AWS CodeCommit repository\n-   < GetRepository>, which returns information about a specified\nrepository\n-   < ListRepositories>, which lists all AWS CodeCommit repositories\nassociated with your AWS account\n-   < UpdateRepositoryDescription>, which sets or updates the\ndescription of the repository\n-   < UpdateRepositoryName>, which changes the name of the\nrepository. If you change the name of a repository, no other\nusers of that repository will be able to access it until you\nsend them the new HTTPS or SSH URL to use.\n-   Branches, by calling the following:\n-   < CreateBranch>, which creates a new branch in a specified\nrepository\n-   < GetBranch>, which returns information about a specified branch\n-   < ListBranches>, which lists all branches for a specified\nrepository\n-   < UpdateDefaultBranch>, which changes the default branch for a\nrepository\n-   Information about committed code in a repository, by calling the\nfollowing:\n-   < GetCommit>, which returns information about a commit,\nincluding commit messages and committer information.\n-   Triggers, by calling the following:\n-   < GetRepositoryTriggers>, which returns information about\ntriggers configured for a repository\n-   < PutRepositoryTriggers>, which replaces all triggers for a\nrepository and can be used to create or delete triggers\n-   < TestRepositoryTriggers>, which tests the functionality of a\nrepository trigger by sending data to the trigger target\nFor information about how to use AWS CodeCommit, see the\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html AWS CodeCommit User Guide>.\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.CodeCommit\" or <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ the AWS Documentation>\nto get started.";
