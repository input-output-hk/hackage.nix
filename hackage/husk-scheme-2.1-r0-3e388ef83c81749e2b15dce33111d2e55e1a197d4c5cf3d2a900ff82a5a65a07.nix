Advanced R5RS features are\nprovided including continuations, hygenic macros, and the\nfull numeric tower.\nHusk is not intended to be a highly optimized version of Scheme.\nRather, the goal of the project is to provide a tight integration\nbetween Haskell and Scheme while at the same time providing a\ngreat opportunity for deeper understanding of both languages.\nIn addition, by closely following the R5RS standard, the intent is\nto develop a Scheme that is as compatible as possible with other\nR5RS Schemes.\nThis package includes a stand-alone executable as well as\na library that allows an interpreter to be embedded within an\nexisting Haskell application.";
