Focus and context are automatically updated when navigating\nup, down, left or right in the value. The term that is in focus can also\nbe modified.\n\nThis library offers a generic Zipper for systems of datatypes. In particular,\nit is possible to move the focus between subterms of different types, in an\nentirely type-safe way. This library is built on top of the multirec library,\nso all that is required to get a Zipper for a datatype system is to instantiate\nthe multirec library for that system.";
