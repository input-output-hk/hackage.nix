      description = "Mostly wraps low-level bit operations provided by GCC builtins, which\ntranslate to specialized instructions where available.\n\nAtomic operations include CAS (compare-and-swap), lock, fetch & add and\nsimilar primitives suitable for low-level shared-memory synchronization.\n\nPrimitives from the 'Extras' subpackage would be useful to have in the proper\n'Data.Bits' package, although this would probably require broader support\nacross different compiler backends.\n\nThe C code dynamically links to @libgcc_s@, which can cause problems in GHCi.\nGHCi does not currently support sonames and tries to open @libgcc_s.so@ while\nignoring e.g. @libgcc_s.so.1@. A possible workaround for GHCi on a linux\nsystem: @ln -s \\/lib\\/libgcc_s.so.1 \\/lib\\/libgcc_s.so@. Let me know about\nany other solutions to this issue for GHCi. Regular GHC compilation uses the\nsystem linker with soname support and does not run into this issue.\n\nRelevant Hackage tickets:\n\n* <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/3563>\n\n* <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/4102>";
