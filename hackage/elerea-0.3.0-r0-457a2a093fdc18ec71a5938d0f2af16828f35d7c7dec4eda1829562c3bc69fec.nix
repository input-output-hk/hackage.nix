Reactivity\nis provided through a latching mechanism where a signal changes its\nbehaviour as dictated by a boolean input signal.\n\nElerea provides an easy to use applicative interface, supports\nrecursive signals (a definition like @sine = integral 0 (integral 1\n(-sine))@ works without a hitch) and arbitrary external input. Cyclic\ndependencies are detected on the fly and resolved by inserting delays\ndynamically, unless the user does it explicitly.\n\nThis is a minimal library that defines only some basic primitives,\nand you are advised to install @elerea-examples@ as well to get an\nidea how to build non-trivial systems with it. The examples are\nseparated in order to minimise the dependencies of the core library.";
