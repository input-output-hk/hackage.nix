      description = "Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a\ndatabase. The database is a simple data file containing records,\neach is a pair of a key and a value. Every key and value is serial\nbytes with variable length. Both binary data and character string\ncan be used as a key and a value. Each key must be unique within a\ndatabase. There is neither concept of data tables nor data\ntypes. Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.\n\nKyoto Cabinet runs very fast. For example, elapsed time to store\none million records is 0.9 seconds for hash database, and 1.1\nseconds for B+ tree database. Moreover, the size of database is\nvery small. For example, overhead for a record is 16 bytes for\nhash database, and 4 bytes for B+ tree database. Furthermore,\nscalability of Kyoto Cabinet is great. The database size can be up\nto 8EB (9.22e18 bytes).\n\nKyoto Cabinet is written in the C++ language, and provided as API\nof C++, C, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, Lua and Haskell. Kyoto Cabinet is\navailable on platforms which have API conforming to C++03 with the\nTR1 library extensions. Kyoto Cabinet is a free software licensed\nunder the GNU General Public License. On the other hand, a\ncommercial license is also provided. If you use Kyoto Cabinet\nwithin a proprietary software, the commercial license is required.\n\nKyoto Cabinet home page:\n<http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/>";
