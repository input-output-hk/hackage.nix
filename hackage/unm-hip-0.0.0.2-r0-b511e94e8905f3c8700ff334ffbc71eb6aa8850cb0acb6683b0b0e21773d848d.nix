The library was designed for use in UNM's Digital Image Processing class but it can be used for a wide range of image processing purposes.\n\n[Changes]\n\n[unm-hip-0.0.0.2]\n\n* Adjusted the label function to reduce to the lowest label values. This results in \"better\" output for areas, boundingBoxes, and centersOfMass\n\n* Added the Arithmetic module that provides support for arithmetic operations on images using scalar values.\n\n[unm-hip-0.0.0.1]\n\n* Added an error if fft or ifft are used with a non power of 2 image\n\n* Fixed error in equivalence labeling in label\n\n* Made consistent if and only if through out documentation\n\n* Fixed typo in Complex.hs haddock under fft.\n\n[unm-hip-0.0.0.0]\n\n* Initial release containing functionality for Boxed Images";
