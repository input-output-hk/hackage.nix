      description = "\"System.Directory.PathWalk\" is an implementation of Python's excellent\nos.walk function.  Given a root directory, it recursively scans all\nsubdirectories, calling a callback with directories and files it finds.\nImportantly, it calls the callback as soon as it finishes scanning each\ndirectory to allow the caller to begin processing results immediately.\n\nMaximum memory usage is O(N+M) where N is the depth of the tree and M\nis the maximum number of entries in a particular directory.\n\n> import System.Directory.PathWalk\n>\n> pathWalk \"some/directory\" \$ \\root dirs files -> do\n>   forM_ files \$ \\file ->\n>     when (\".hs\" `isSuffixOf` file) \$ do\n>       putStrLn \$ joinPath [root, file]";
