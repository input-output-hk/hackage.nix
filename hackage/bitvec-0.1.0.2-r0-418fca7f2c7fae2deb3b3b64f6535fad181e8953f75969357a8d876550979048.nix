This one defines a `Bit`\ntype (which is an instance of all the \"expected\" classes, including\nnumeric ones) and makes that type an instance of `Data.Vector.Unboxed.\nUnbox`, so we get a lot of nice APIs for free.  `Bool` is already an\nunboxable type, but the current unboxed `Vector` implementation packs\neach bit as a byte.  This one packs 8 bits per byte, as expected\n(`UArray` from the `array` package also uses one bit per `Bool`).\n\nIn addition to the `Vector` interface, there are several high-level\noperations and some low-level ones suitable for building new bulk\noperations by viewing the bit-vector as a word vector.";
