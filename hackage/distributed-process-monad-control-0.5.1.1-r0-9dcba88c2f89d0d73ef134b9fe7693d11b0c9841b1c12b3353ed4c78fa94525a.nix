This is for use\nin conjunction with a library requiring these instances, such as the\n@<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lifted-base lifted-base> package.\n\nA tutorial segment regarding use of this in distributed-process applications may\nbe found <http://haskell-distributed.github.io/tutorials/3ch.html#monad-transformer-stacks here>.\n\nPlease excercise caution in usage of this instance, as it can\nenable use of functions such as 'forkIO' (or, 'fork' from 'lifted-base')\nwhich compromise invariants in the Process monad and can lead to confusing\nand subtle issues. Always use the Cloud Haskell functions such as `spawnLocal` instead.\n\nexample usage:\n\n>import Control.Distributed.Process.MonadBaseControl()\n>import Control.Concurrent.MVar.Lifted (withMVar)\n>\n>processWithMVar :: MVar a -> (a -> Process b) -> Process b\n>processWithMvar = withMVar";
