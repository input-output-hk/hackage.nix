A C library is included to make writing new plugins/adapting programs to be plugins easy.\n\n* Set up through a configuration file.\n\n* Multiple channels.\n\n* Multi-threaded\n\n* Lightweight, typically running at under 5mb of private memory.\n\nCons:\n\n* POSIX memory management, process forking, and chroot means that Esotericbot is POSIX only.\n\n* Esotericbot is, due to the libraries and extensions used, restricted to being compiled by the Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler.\n\n\nNote: esotericbot comes with several plugins which will be installed into your cabal-bin, and libraries installed into your cabal-lib.  Check cabal-bin for 'brainfuck', 'unlambda' , 'malbolge', 'sk' and 'whirl'.  These will need libplugin and libplugin++ from your cabal-lib to function correctly.";
