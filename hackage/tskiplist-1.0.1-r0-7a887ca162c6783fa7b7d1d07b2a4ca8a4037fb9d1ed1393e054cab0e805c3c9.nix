A skip list is a probabilistic data structure with dictionary operations and support for efficient range-queries (similarly to Data.Map). In contrast to tree data structures, a skip list does not need any rebalancing, which makes it particularly suitable for concurrent programming. (See: William Pugh. Skip Lists: A Probabilistic Alternative to Balanced Trees.)";
