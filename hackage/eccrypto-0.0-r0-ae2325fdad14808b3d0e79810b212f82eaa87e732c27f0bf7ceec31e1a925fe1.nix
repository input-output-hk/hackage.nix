Timing-attack resistance is important, failure must be documented.\n\nThis library was formerly known and its code originated as hecc, but since this would imply Hyperelliptic ECC, the name was changed.\n\nAlso the scope was changed by selecting best internal formats and no longer trying to be overly general, allowing more optimizations.\n\nN.B.: F2 is faulty and slow.\n\nMore secure curves will be added.";
