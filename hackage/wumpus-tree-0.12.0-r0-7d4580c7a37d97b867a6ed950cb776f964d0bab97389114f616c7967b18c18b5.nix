The\noutput should be quite good - no overlapping edges, identical\nsubtrees should have the same shape, leaf nodes evenly spaced.\n\nNote - the demos now use font metrics. Font metrics for the\n\\\"Core 14\\\" PostScript fonts are distributed as @*.afm@ files\nwith GhostScript (AFM file version 2.0 for GhostScript 8.63) or\navailable from Adode (AFM file version 4.1). To run the demos\nproperly you will need one of these sets of metrics.\n\nAdobe Font techinal notes:\n<https://www.adobe.com/devnet/font.html>\n\nCore 14 AFM metrics:\n<https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/font/pdfs/Core14_AFMs.tar>\n\n\n\\*\\* WARNING \\*\\* - the API is unstable and will change.\n\nChangelog:\n\nv0.11.1 to v.0.12.0:\n\n* Internal changes to track updates to Wumpus-Basic.\n\n";
