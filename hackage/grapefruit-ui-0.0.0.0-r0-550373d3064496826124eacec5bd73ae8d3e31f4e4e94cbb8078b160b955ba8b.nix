      description = "Grapefruit is a library for Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) with a focus on\nuser interfaces. FRP makes it possible to implement reactive and interactive systems\nin a declarative style. To learn more about FRP, have a look at\n<http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Functional_Reactive_Programming>.\n\nThis package contains general user interface support. To make use of it, it has to be\ncomplemented by a UI backend. It is possible to have different UI backends\nimplementing the same general interface on top of different UI toolkits. At the\nmoment, the only backend is one based on GTK+. This is provided by the\ngrapefruit-ui-gtk package.";
