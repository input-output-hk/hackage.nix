Kent Dybvig, Simon Peyton Jones, and Amr Sabry\nJFP, v17, N6, pp. 687--730, 2007.\n<http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/techreports/TRNNN.cgi?trnum=TR615>\n\nThis library is the most direct implementation of the bubble-up reduction\nsemantics of multi-prompt delimited control. The library stands out in not\nbeing based on the continuation monad. Rather, the monad of \"Control.Monad.CC.CCExc\"\nis an extension of the 'Error' monad: a monad for restartable exceptions.\nThe library offers not one monad transformer but a family ('CC' 'p')\nparameterized by the prompt flavor 'p' . The library defines several prompt\nflavors; the users are welcome to define their own.\n\nSee the original article at <http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/implementations.html#CC-monads>\nfor more information.\n\nThis package split multi-prompt delimited control from\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/liboleg> for usability.";
