      description = "Aivika is a small simulation library that covers many paradigms.\nIt allows integrating a system of ordinary differential equations.\nAlso it can be applied to the Discrete Event Simulation. It supports\nthe event-oriented, process-oriented and activity-oriented paradigms.\nAivika also supports the Agent-based Modeling. Finally, it can be applied\nto System Dynamics.\n\nIt is possible due to using a very general approach when the basic\nmodeling entity is just a function of simulation time. The paradigms\nare mainly distinguished by sets of the functions that are used to\nmodel the activities. These sets are small and do not pretend\nto be comprehensive. Aivika is mostly a proof-of-concept project\nrather than a big library that knows everything.\n\nThe library widely uses monads. The dynamic system is represented as\na computation in the Dynamics monad. There is also the Process\nmonad to represent the discontinuous processes which can suspend\nat any time and then resume later. There is also the Simulation monad\nthat represents a simulation run, in which scope the previous\ntwo monads exist. Almost everything is expressed through these monads,\nincluding the event handlers, agent handlers and even integrals\nexcept for the parameters and statistics that already use the IO monad.\n\nThe PDF documentation is available at\n<https://github.com/dsorokin/aivika/blob/master/doc/aivika.pdf>.\nPlease note that the documentation is outdated and it corresponds to\nversion 0.2 but it can still be helpful.\n";
