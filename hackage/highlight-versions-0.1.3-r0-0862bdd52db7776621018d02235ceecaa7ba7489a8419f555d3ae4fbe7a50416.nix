In\naddition, when the versions are unequal the\nHackage version is shown in blue.\n\nIn particular, it can be useful to pipe the\noutput of @cabal(-dev) install --dry-run@ through\nthis program, to aid in checking the install\nplan. It's usually a good idea to understand why\nan outdated package is being installed; otherwise\nit can indicate that something needs to be updated.\n\nPLEASE NOTE that highlight-versions does not\nactually consult Hackage, but rather your local\nindex of Hackage cached by cabal. You must call\n'cabal update' to be sure that\nhighlight-versions has access to the latest\ninformation about package versions on Hackage.";
