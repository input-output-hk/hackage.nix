      description = "\nKernel code for higher-level drawing built on Wumpus-Core. This\npackage provides font loader code (currently limited to AFM font\nfiles) and a various /drawing objects/ intended to be a\nhigher-level basis to make vector drawings than the primitives\n(paths, text labels) provided by Wumpus-Core.\n\n\\*\\* WARNING \\*\\* - this package is alpha grade and it is\nstrongly coupled to the package @Wumpus-Drawing@ which is\nsub-alpha grade. The packages are split as it is expected they\nwill have different development speeds - @Wumpus-Basic@ needs\npolishing and refinement; @Wumpus-Drawing@ simply needs a lot of\nwork to move its components from /proof-of-concept/ ideas to\nbeing readily usable.\n\n\nNOTE - the demos that were previously included are now in the\npackage @Wumpus-Drawing@.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\nv0.19.0 to v0.20.0:\n\n* Added text advance-vector calculations to @QueryDC@ -\npreviously they were in Wumpus-Drawing.\n\n* Changed argument order of @run@ functions to follow the usual\nstyle - monadic action first and then dependent parameters\n(initial state, reader environment etc.).\n\n* Changed representation of Chains to a monadic type with an\nexplicit operation for next position.\n\n* Removed @PrimW@ type - pairs are now used instead.\n\n* Removed transformer version of @TraceDrawing@. All operations\nin TraceDrawing are now specialized to work only on the\n@TraceDrawing@ type. Added @UserState@ to TraceDrawing and\nother drawing monads to compensate for the loss of\nexpressiveness.\n\n* Changed the internals of @AdvObject@ and @PosObject@ so they\nare more idiomatic - both are now essentially reader-writer\nmonads. Added PosObject functions for text primitives (moved\nfrom Wumpus-Drawing).\n\n* Changed the @obliterate@ method of the @Decorate@ class.\n";
