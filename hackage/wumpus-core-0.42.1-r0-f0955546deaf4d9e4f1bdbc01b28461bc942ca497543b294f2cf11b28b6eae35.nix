      description = "\nWumpus-Core is a low-level library for generating static 2D\nvector pictures, its salient feature is portability due to no\nFFI dependencies. It can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG\nfiles. The generated PostScript code is plain and reasonably\nefficient as the use of stack operations, i.e @gsave@ and\n@grestore@, is minimized.\n\nAlthough Wumpus-Core only generates vector output, the generated\nPostScript can be interpreted by GraphicsMagick or a similar\ntool to convert EPS files into bitmap image files (e.g JPEGs).\n\nWumpus-Core makes pictures from /paths/ and text /labels/. Paths\nthemselves are made from points. The usual affine\ntransformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be\napplied to Pictures. Unlike PostScript there is no notion of a\ncurrent point, Wumpus-Core builds pictures in a coordinate-free\nstyle.\n\nGENERAL DRAWBACKS...\n\nFor actually building pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus-Core is\nvery low-level. There are two supplementary packages\n@Wumpus-Basic@ and @Wumpus-Drawing@ also on Hackage that aim to\nbe a higher-level basis for creating certain types of diagram,\nbut they are experimental - functionality is added and dropped\nbetween releases and curently the API is too unstable to write\ncode upon (they should be considered a technology preview rather\nthan re-usable libraries).\n\nAlso, some of the design decisions made for Wumpus-Core are not\nsophisticated - e.g. how path and text attributes like colour are\nhandled, and how the bounding boxes of text labels are\ncalculated. Compared to other systems, Wumpus might be rather\nlimited, however, the design permits a fairly simple\nimplementation.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\nv0.42.0 to v0.42.1:\n\n* Fixed bug in the @curvedPath@ function in @Core.Picture@\nwhere the wrong relative point was being calculated for the\nsecond control point.\n\n* Changed internals of the @EscapedText@ type so it supports\nefficient concatenation, and now has a Monoid instance.\n\nv0.41.0 to v0.42.0:\n\n* Removed the function @oboundingBox@ from @Core.BoundingBox@.\nIt was unused in Wumpus-Core and had unwise error handling\nbaked-in.\n\n* Renamed @direction@ in @Wumpus.Core.Geometry@, it is now\n@vdirection@.\n\n* Fixed internal Foldable instances for JoinList. The left and\nright folds worked in the wrong direction.\n\n* Some improvements to the Haddock documentation.\n\n";
