Also @Matrix@ derives 'Data.Typeable'\nnow.\n\n[@v0.1.4@] Added @scale@, and methods for joining\nmatrices vertically and horizontally. Corrected\na bug in @isUnit@ reported by Charles Durham.\n@isUnit@ returned True for any matrix for which\n@all (== 1) . trace@ would have, which is wrong).\n\n[@v0.2@] A little bit more documentation. Also moved some\nfunctions (@isXXX@) away from the type class @MatrixElement@.\nProperly flagged the package as experimental (was\nimproperly copied as @stable@, copied form a template).";
