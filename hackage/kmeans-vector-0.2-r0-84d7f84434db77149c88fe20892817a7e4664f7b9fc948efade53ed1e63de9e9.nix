The goal of this algorithm is to, given a list of n-dimensional points, regroup them in k groups, such that each point gets to be in the group to which it is the closest to (using the 'center' of the group).\n\nCHANGELOG\n\nkmeans-vector-0.2 supports having feature vectors associated to objects, and thus computing kmeans on these vectors, letting you recover the initial objects.";
