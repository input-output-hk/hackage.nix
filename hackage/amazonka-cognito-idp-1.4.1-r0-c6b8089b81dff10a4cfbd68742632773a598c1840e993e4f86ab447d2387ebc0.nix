You can authenticate a user to obtain tokens\nrelated to user identity and access policies.\nThis API reference provides information about user pools in Amazon\nCognito Identity, which is a new capability that is available as a beta.\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.CognitoIdentityProvider\" or <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ the AWS Documentation>\nto get started.";
