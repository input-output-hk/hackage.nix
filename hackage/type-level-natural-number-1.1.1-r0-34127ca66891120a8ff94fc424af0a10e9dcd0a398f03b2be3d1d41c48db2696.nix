Operations requiring\nnon-Haskell 2010 language extensions have been split\ninto a separate package.\n\nThe difference between this package and the many\nothers on Hackage implementing type-level\nnaturals is its emphasis on simplicity.  It only\nsupports non-negative natural numbers, and only\nthe successor and predicessor operations.  It\nrepresents natural numbers using a type-level\nlinked list, so it is not intended to be used for\nrepresenting large numbers.  Pre-defined aliases\nfor natural numbers up to 15 are provided.\n\nThe code for this package was largely taken from\nthe excellent Vec package; I created this package\nwith the intent of making this functionality more\nwidely available.\n\nDifference from 1.0:  Added instances for Typeable, and\nword synonyms for N0...N15.\n\nDifference from 1.1:  Performance enhancements for\nnaturalNumberAsInt.  Simplified Show implementation.";
