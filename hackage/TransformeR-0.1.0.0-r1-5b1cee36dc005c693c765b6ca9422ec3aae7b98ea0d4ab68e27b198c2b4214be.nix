      description = "Arbitrary data transformations that work at the level of single individual data\ncan be safely applied before applying a differentially private data analysis if\nan adversary only gets to observe the result of the differentially private analysis.\nThe current version of the PSI prototype offers support for writing variable\ntransformations as R programs that can be run on the data before running\nthe other private statistics. Arbitrary R programs can allow for leakage of\ninformation beyond the output, and \"side-channel attacks\" where an adversary\nobserves this additional leakage and thereby undermines the privacy guarantees.\nTransformeR is a subset of the R language that can serve\nas a domain specifc language useful to write the needed data transformations and\nat the same time be more maneageable for preventing security weaknesses\nand side-channel attacks.";
