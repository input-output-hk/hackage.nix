This requires some time-consuming checks,\nso show is slow for floating-point numbers. By producing\na digit-string guaranteed to be long enough to uniquely\ndetermine the number without caring whether there's a\nshorter representation, the display functions of this\npackage can be faster, sometimes by a big margin.\nText.FShow.Raw provides building blocks for representations\nof numeric types which don't belong to RealFloat but have\nsome of its functionality.\nThe bulk of the code is a minor modification of code from\nthe base package, whence the GHC License is included as\nan extra-source-file.";
