As our\npatches support operational transform, edits can be\nmade to any version of each document and they are\ntransformed to be applied to the latest version.\n\nThis also makes it easy to use the group structure of\npatches to be able to revert changes (or the composition\nof several changes) from deep in a document's history and\npreserve every other change.\n\nRight now the wiki doesn't support many bells and whistles,\nsuch as administrator control, configurability, or user accounts,\nbut they're coming.";
