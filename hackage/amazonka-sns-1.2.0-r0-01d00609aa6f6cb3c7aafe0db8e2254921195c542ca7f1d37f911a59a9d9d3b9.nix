Applications\ncan use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to\ninterested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more\ninformation about this product see\n<http://aws.amazon.com/sns/ http:\\/\\/aws.amazon.com\\/sns>. For detailed\ninformation about Amazon SNS features and their associated API calls,\nsee the\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/ Amazon SNS Developer Guide>.\nWe also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your\npreferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that\nautomatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing\nyour service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses.\nFor a list of available SDKs, go to\n<http://aws.amazon.com/tools/ Tools for Amazon Web Services>.\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.SNS\" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\nto get started.";
