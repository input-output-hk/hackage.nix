This\nmeans being able to merge multiple paths, that may overlap at the root, in\na sensible way. The module comes with a set of functions to add paths.\n\nA Left-Children-Right-Siblings tree ('LCRSTree') is a tree that represents\na multi-way tree (aka, a Rose Tree) in a binary-tree format. It is the\nunderlying implementation of 'PathTree'.\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-child_right-sibling_binary_tree>";
