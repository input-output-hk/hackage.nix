It should be possible to express\nany formula that might be found in a typical mathematics or physics journal article.\nThis should also include expression which are not quite well-defined from a programming\npoint of view, but are clear to the intended audience.\n\n* Idiomatic Haskell syntax. Who wants to bother with unreadable expressions involving\neither hundreds of double-backslashes or extra syntax overhead in wrapping them\nexplicitly into HaTeX?\n\nIdeally, one would write expressions as if only meaning Haskell to /calculate/ them,\nbut get the result back as a full pretty-printing LaTeX math string. /And the actual\ncalculated result as well/, if possible!\n\nTo this end, we use a minimal symbolic-manipulation EDSL, namely\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dumb-cas dumb-cas>, set up in a way so the\nleaves of the syntax tree, i.e. the individual symbols, are represented by LaTeX\nexpressions in memory and by single-letter variables in the Haskell code.\nThese can then be combined with operators corresponding to LaTeX's maths operators,\nto obtain a very compact and almost WYSIWYG-like code appearance, while retaining\nthe ability to apply any LaTeX-specific tweaks whenever necessary. At the same\ntime, because the AST is fully precedence-aware, it is safely possible to transform\nthe expressions via e.g. Template Haskell, to actually compute concrete numerical\nresults, or apply exact symbolic-manipulation techniques.";
