Unfortunately, both classes are frequently used in the Haskell\necosystem, since they have minor differences.\n\nDue to these typeclasses being unrelated, itâ€™s not entirely uncommon to end up\nwith type signatures like @('MonadIO' m, 'MonadBaseControl' 'IO' m) => ...@,\nwhich are a little silly, since @'MonadBaseControl' 'IO'@ really includes all\nthe power of 'MonadIO'.\n\nTo help alleviate this problem, this package provides a set of utilities for\nconverting between the two constraints in situations where possible.";
