Although this implementation does follow the\nRFC as closely as possible as well as Amazon AWS's implementation.\nHoweber, since nothing is formally specified these modules are\nspecifically built for each other Because of this, we also try to\nmaintain a slim dependency profile.  Because of the compatibility\nwith http-client you can still build into a streaming module if\nneeded";
