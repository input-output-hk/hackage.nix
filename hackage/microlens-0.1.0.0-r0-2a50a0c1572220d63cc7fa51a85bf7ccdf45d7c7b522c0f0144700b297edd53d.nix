It is compatible with @lens@, and should have same\nperformance.\n\nUse this library:\n\n* if you want to define lenses or traversals in your own library, but\ndon't want to depend on @lens@\n* if you are new to lenses and want a small library to play with,\nbut don't want to use something “inferior” or have to relearn things\nwhen/if you switch to @lens@\n\nDon't use this library:\n\n* if you need @Iso@s, @Prism@s, indexed traversals, @at@, @ix@,\nor actually anything else which isn't defined here\n* if you think lenses compose “in the wrong order” (in which case\nyou're looking for @fclabels@)\n\nNote that microlens has /no/ dependencies starting from GHC 7.10\n(base-4.8). Prior to that, it has to depend on transformers-0.2 or above.";
