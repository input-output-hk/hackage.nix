For more information, please see ForSyDe's website: <http://forsyde.ict.kth.se/>. For examples and tutorials using @ForSyDe.Shallow@, check the <https://github.com/forsyde/forsyde-shallow-examples forsyde-shallow-examples> repository.\n\nThis package is a spin-off of the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ForSyDe ForSyDe> project and it follows its versioning.";
