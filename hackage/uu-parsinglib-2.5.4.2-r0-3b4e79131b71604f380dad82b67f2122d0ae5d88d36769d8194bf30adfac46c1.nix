      description = "New version of the Utrecht University parser combinator library, which  provides online, error correction,\nannotation free, applicative style parser combinators. In addition to this we do  provide a monadic interface.\nParsers do analyse themselves to avoid commonly made errors. A recent addition was the combinator @`pMerge`@ and\nassociates which generalises merging and permuting parsers.\n\nThe module \"Text.ParserCombinators.UU.Examples\" contains a  ready-made @main@  function,\nwhich can be called to see e.g. the error correction at work. It contains haddock documentation;\ntry all the small tests for yourself to see the correction process at work, and to get a\nfeeling for how to use the various combinators.\n\nThe file \"Text.ParserCombinators.UU.Changelog\" contains a log of the most recent changes and additions\n\nThe file \"Text.ParserCombinators.UU.README\" contains some references to background information\n";
