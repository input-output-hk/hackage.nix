Its main purpose is to enable an efficient and uniform /static code analysis/,\nas part of the [dhscanner](https://github.com/OrenGitHub/dhscanner) framework\nfor [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) container security checks.\nAs part of that framework, it targets mostly languages used for /cloud native applications/:\n__Python__, __Ruby__, __Php__, __Javascript__, __Typescript__, __Java__, __C#__ and __Golang__.\nTypically, a collection of files are first parsed using relevant\n[parsers](https://github.com/OrenGitHub/dhscanner.1.parsers), then,\nthe resulting collection of abstract syntax trees is sent to code generation,\nwhere it is translated into a collection of /callables/.\nA callable is a sequence of commands corresponding to either a function, a method\nor (in languages like python) a script. The design of commands was done with simplicity\nin mind. The commands resemble an abstract RISC-style assembley, motivated by keeping\nlater-phases analyses as simple as possible.";
