They run the action and potentially retry\nrunning it with some configurable delay for a configurable\nnumber of times.\nThe purpose is to make it easier to work with IO and\nespecially network IO actions that often experience temporary\nfailure and warrant retrying of the original action. For\nexample, a database query may time out for a while, in which\ncase we should hang back for a bit and retry the query instead\nof simply raising an exception.";
