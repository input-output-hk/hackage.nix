      description = "A wait-free tree counter. Creates a binary tree of counters, with each leaf associated with a thread. Leaves can be split, creating a new leaf for the current thread and another that can be used by another thread. Each thread will act on different leaves, meaning the actions are wait-free. A read is performed on the counter by recursively traversing it and summing the value of the counters in the nodes and leaves of the tree. (UPDATE: removed useless dependency)";
