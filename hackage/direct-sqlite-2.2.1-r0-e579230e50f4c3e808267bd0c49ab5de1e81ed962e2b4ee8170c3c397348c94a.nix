      description = "This package is not very different from the other SQLite3 bindings out\nthere, but it fixes a few deficiencies I was finding.  It is not as\ncomplete as bindings-sqlite3, but is slightly higher-level, in that it\nsupports marshalling of data values to and from the database.  In\nparticular, it supports strings encoded as UTF8, and BLOBs represented\nas ByteStrings.\n\nRelease history:\n\n[Version 2.2.1] Bump down text library version to match with the\nlatest Haskell Platform.\n\n[Version 2.2] actually does what version 2.1 claimed to, since the author\nmade a mistake with git.\n\n[Version 2.1] improves handling of invalid UTF-8 and changes error handling\nto be more complete.  It also adds a build flag to build against the system\nsqlite instead of the bundled one, optionally (disabled by default).\n\n[Version 2.0] uses Text for strings instead of String.\n\n[Version 1.1.0.1] switches to the Faction packaging system and makes no other\nchanges.\n\n[Version 1.1] adds the SQLite amalgamation file (version 3.7.5) to the\nproject, so that there are no external dependencies.";
