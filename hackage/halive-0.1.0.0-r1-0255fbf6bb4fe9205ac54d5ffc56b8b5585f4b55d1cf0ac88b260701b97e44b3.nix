Learn how to maintain state in the next section.\n\nTry a live-coding GL demo by running @halive demo\\/Main.hs@ (in the\nsource package)\nand changing values in @Main.hs@ and @Green.hs@\n(requires @gl@, @GLFW-b@, @foreign-store@, @linear@, and @random@).\n\n== Keeping values alive\n\nTo keep state alive, import @Halive.Utils@ and wrap\nyour value in @reacquire@ along with a unique identifier, like:\n\n@win \\<- reacquire 0 (setupGLFW \\\"HotGLFW\\\" 640 480)@\n\nto only create the resource the first time you run the program, and then\nreuse it on subsequent recompilations.\n\nYou can see this in action in @test\\/glfw.hs@.\n\nThanks to Chris Done\\'s\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/foreign-store @foreign-store@>\nlibrary for enabling this.\n\n== Notes\n\nCreating, updating, and deleting modules in the include path should\nwork fine during a Halive session.\n\nHalive also supports Cabal sandboxes;\nif run within a directory containing a cabal.sandbox.config file it will\nuse the package database defined therein.\n\nHalive also works nicely with either batch-processing or run-loop type\nprograms — if the program finishes, it will be restarted on next save,\nand if it\\'s still running, it will be killed and restarted on save.\n\nTo kill Halive during run-loop type programs, you may need to hold down\nCtrl-C\nto get GHC to recognize the double-Control-C-kill sequence.\n\n<http://twitter.com/lukexi \\@lukexi>";
