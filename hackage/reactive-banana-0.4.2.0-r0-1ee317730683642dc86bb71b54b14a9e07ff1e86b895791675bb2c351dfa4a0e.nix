Write some parts with FRP!\nDon't know how to express something with FRP?\nSwitch back to imperative style!\n\nIn the spectrum of possible FRP implementations,\nthis one features simple semantics but modest expressivity.\nPredicting space & time usage should be easy.\n\nStability forecast:\nKnown inefficiencies that will be addressed.\nNo semantic bugs expected.\nSignificant API changes are likely in future versions.";
