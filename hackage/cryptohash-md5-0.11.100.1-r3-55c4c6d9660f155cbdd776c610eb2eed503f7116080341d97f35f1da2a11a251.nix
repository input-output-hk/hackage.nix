The API exposed by @cryptohash-md5-0.11.*@'s\n\"Crypto.Hash.MD5\" module is guaranteed to remain a compatible superset of the API provided\nby the @cryptohash-0.11.7@'s module of the same name.\n\nConsequently, this package is designed to be used as a drop-in replacement for @cryptohash-0.11.7@'s\n\"Crypto.Hash.MD5\" module, though with\na [clearly smaller footprint by almost 3 orders of magnitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/5lxv75/psa_please_use_unique_module_names_when_uploading/dbzegx3/).\n";
