The\ninitial basis for this library was Morten Rhiger's \\\"Type-safe\npattern combinators\\\"; the patterns can be used in an almost\nidentical way to those of Morten Rhiger. In a series of blog\nposts at\n<http://reinerp.wordpress.com/category/pattern-combinators/>\nthe types of patterns were made more revealing using type\nfamilies, and a simpler implementation was used which avoids\nsome book-keeping.\n\nThe library reimplements most of Haskell's built-in\npattern matching facilities, plus some more. The pattern\nmatches of this library are lightweight: when GHC's\noptimisation is turned on, all overhead should be optimised\naway, leaving a standard Haskell pattern match.\n\nIf you're just reading the documentation for this library for\nthe first time, start with \"Data.Pattern\".";
