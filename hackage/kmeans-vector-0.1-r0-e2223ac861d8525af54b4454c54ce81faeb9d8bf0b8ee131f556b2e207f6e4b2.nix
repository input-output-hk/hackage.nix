The goal of this algorithm is to, given a list of n-dimensional points, regroup them in k groups, such that each point gets to be in the group to which it is the closest to (using the 'center' of the group).\n\nSample output (after some gnuplot hackery -- see the tests dir in the repository): <http://i.imgur.com/IpIPC.png>\n\nExpect some improvements on the initial clustering, thus resulting in a better clustering, for future versions.";
