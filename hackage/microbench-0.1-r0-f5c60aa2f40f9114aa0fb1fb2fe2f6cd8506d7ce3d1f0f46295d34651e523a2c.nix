Since most code is very fast, to\nget accurate timing information you must run the operation many times\nand then divide to get the time per operation.\n\nThis library manages the microbenchmarking process: it finds how many\niterations of a function are needed to get a good timing estimate per\niteration and prints out a human-readable \\\"Your code takes /n/ nanoseconds\nto run, and can run /n/ times per second\\\".";
