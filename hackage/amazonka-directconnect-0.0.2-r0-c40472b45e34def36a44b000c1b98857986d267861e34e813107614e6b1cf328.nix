With this connection in place, you can create virtual\ninterfaces directly to the AWS cloud and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud,\nbypassing Internet service providers in your network path.\n\n/See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\n\n/Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under\nheavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!";
