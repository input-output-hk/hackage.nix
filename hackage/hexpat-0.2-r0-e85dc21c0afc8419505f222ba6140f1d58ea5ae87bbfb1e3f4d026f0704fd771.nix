It is known for being simple and fast.\n\nThere are already nice XML libraries in the Text.XML hierarchy.  The\nreason to use Expat is when speed is of concern.  From a benchmark\nthat compares getting the length of the root node of a HaXml tree\n(presumably forcing parsing the entire file) against running an Expat\nparser with a registered start node handler, Expat is about 12 times\nfaster.  This is not a fair benchmark; HaXml does a lot more than this\nExpat library.  But if Expat suffices, it is good for what it does.";
