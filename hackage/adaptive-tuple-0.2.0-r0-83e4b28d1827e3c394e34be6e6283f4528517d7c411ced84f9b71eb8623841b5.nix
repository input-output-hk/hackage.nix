These structures are designed to combine\nthe space-efficiency of tuples with the size flexibility of lists.\n\nAdaptive tuples provide lazy and strict, unpacked data structures\nfor all tuple sizes from 0 to 20 elements.  Adaptive tuples of more than\n20 elements are allowed, however they are stored in an ordinary list.";
