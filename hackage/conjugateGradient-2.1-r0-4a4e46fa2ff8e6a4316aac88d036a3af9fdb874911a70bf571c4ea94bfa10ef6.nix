Note that the\ntechnique only applies to matrices that are symmetric and positive-definite.\nSee <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method> for details.\n\nThe conjugate gradient method can handle very large sparse matrices, where direct\nmethods (such as LU decomposition) are way too expensive to be useful in practice.\nSuch large sparse matrices arise naturally in many engineering problems, such as\nin ASIC placement algorithms and when solving partial differential equations.";
