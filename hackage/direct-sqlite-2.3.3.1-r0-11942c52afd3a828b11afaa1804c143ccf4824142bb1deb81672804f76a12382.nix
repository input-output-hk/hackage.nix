      description = "This package is not very different from the other SQLite3 bindings out\nthere, but it fixes a few deficiencies I was finding.  As compared to\nbindings-sqlite3, it is slightly higher-level, in that it supports\nmarshalling of data values to and from the database.  In particular, it\nsupports strings encoded as UTF8, and BLOBs represented as ByteStrings.\n\nRelease history:\n\n[Version 2.3.3.1] Upgrade bundled SQLite3 to 3.7.15.2.\n\n[Version 2.3.3] Add trace support, as a feature for debugging.\n\n[Version 2.3.2] Add execPrint, execWithCallback, and interruptibly functions.\nAdd bindings for sqlite3_last_insert_rowid and sqlite3_changes.  Change the\nShow instance of the Utf8 newtype to better match the IsString instance.\n\n[Version 2.3.1] Upgrade the bundled SQLite3 to 3.7.15.  Add bindings for\nsqlite3_interrupt.  Export Int rather than CInt.\n\n[Version 2.3] Mark some FFI calls \"unsafe\", for a substantial performance\nbenefit.\n\n[Version 2.2.1] Bump down text library version to match with the\nlatest Haskell Platform.\n\n[Version 2.2] actually does what version 2.1 claimed to, since the author\nmade a mistake with git.\n\n[Version 2.1] improves handling of invalid UTF-8 and changes error handling\nto be more complete.  It also adds a build flag to build against the system\nsqlite instead of the bundled one, optionally (disabled by default).\n\n[Version 2.0] uses Text for strings instead of String.\n\n[Version 1.1.0.1] switches to the Faction packaging system and makes no other\nchanges.\n\n[Version 1.1] adds the SQLite amalgamation file (version 3.7.5) to the\nproject, so that there are no external dependencies.";
