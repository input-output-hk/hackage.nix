Currently hp2pretty outputs Scalable\nVector Graphics (SVG) only, though PostScript (PS) is planned.\nAlso none (count'em) of hp2ps' options are implemented yet in\nhp2pretty.\n\nIn hp2pretty-0.6 ByteString is replaced by Text, fixing bugs\nwith Unicode.\n\nIn hp2pretty-0.5 using attoparsec and floatshow internally\nshould give a healthy speedup.\n\nIn hp2pretty-0.4 usage changed since the previous release:\n\nhp2pretty *.hp\n\nhp2pretty --uniform-scale=time   *.hp\n\nhp2pretty --uniform-scale=memory *.hp\n\nhp2pretty --uniform-scale=both   *.hp\n\nColours also changed: now they are based on a hash of the\ncost label, which should make colours have stable semantics\nacross program runs.";
