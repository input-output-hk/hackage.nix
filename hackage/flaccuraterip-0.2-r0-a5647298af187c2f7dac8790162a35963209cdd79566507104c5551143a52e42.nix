      description = "/flAccurateRip/ is a command line tool to verify the accuracy of FLAC\nfiles ripped form CD, using the information contained in the\nAccurateRip™ database about other rips of the same CD.\n\nUsage: suppose you ripped a CD into @track01.flac@, @track02.flac@,\n..., @trackNN.flac@. Open a shell in the directory containing the\nFLAC files, and run:\n\n>>> flaccuraterip track01.flac track02.flac ... trackNN.flac\n\nIf a pressing of this CD is present in the AccurateRip™ database,\n@flaccuraterip@ will output the ripping accuracy for each track. If\nthe CD was ripped without setting the drive offset, you should use\nthe flag @--sample-offset=N@, where N is the offset indicated in\n<http://accuraterip.com/driveoffsets.htm> for your drive.";
