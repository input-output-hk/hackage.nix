They supports @O(log(n))@ lookup\nwhile still having amortized @O(1)@ access to the left end of the sequence.\nSomewhat similar to finger trees, but much simpler, and the ternary and\nquaternary versions are also more memory efficient; however, modifying\nthe right end of the sequence is still slow. See \"Data.Nested.Seq\"\nfor general comments and \"Data.Nested.Seq.Binary.Lazy\" for an explanation\nof the data structure.";
