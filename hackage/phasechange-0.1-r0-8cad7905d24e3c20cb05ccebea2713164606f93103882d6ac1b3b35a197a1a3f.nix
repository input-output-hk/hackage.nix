      description = "This library provides a class for types which present the same underlying data in both an immutable (frozen) as well as a mutable (thawed) form,\nand various functions to manipulate them. Some of the functions allow for copy elision.\n\nInstances are provided for the array types from the @primitive@, @array@, and @vector@ packages, but this is mainly for completeness: there is\nnothing these instances do which @vector@ doesn't already do better. The main purpose, rather, is to assist new types, for instance types whose implementation relies on destructive-update foreign imports, and cases when writing a full stream fusion framework isn't practical.\n\nThere are three modules:\n\n[Data.PhaseChange] This module exports the class without its methods, together with functions which guarantee referential transparency\n(provided that instances are well-behaved). This is the module you should normally import to work with PhaseChangeable data.\n\n[Data.PhaseChange.Unsafe] This module exports functions which can break referential transparency if they are used improperly. Be careful.\n\n[Data.PhaseChange.Impl] This module exports the class along with its methods. Import it if you want to define a new instance.";
