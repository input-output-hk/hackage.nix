      description = "<https://github.com/snowleopard/alga Alga> is a library for algebraic construction and\nmanipulation of graphs in Haskell. See <https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper this paper>\nfor the motivation behind the library, the underlying theory and implementation details.\n\nThe top-level module\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph.html Algebra.Graph>\ndefines the main data type for /algebraic graphs/\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph.html#t:Graph Graph>,\nas well as associated algorithms. For type-safe representation and\nmanipulation of /non-empty algebraic graphs/, see\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-NonEmpty.html Algebra.Graph.NonEmpty>.\nFurthermore, /algebraic graphs with edge labels/ are implemented in\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-Labelled.html Algebra.Graph.Labelled>.\n\nThe library also provides conventional graph data structures, such as\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-AdjacencyMap.html Algebra.Graph.AdjacencyMap>\nalong with its various flavours: adjacency maps specialised to graphs with\nvertices of type 'Int'\n(<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-AdjacencyIntMap.html Algebra.Graph.AdjacencyIntMap>),\nnon-empty adjacency maps\n(<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-NonEmpty-AdjacencyMap.html Algebra.Graph.NonEmpty.AdjacencyMap>),\nand adjacency maps with edge labels\n(<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-Labelled-AdjacencyMap.html Algebra.Graph.Labelled.AdjacencyMap>).\nA large part of the API of algebraic graphs and adjacency maps is available\nthrough the 'Foldable'-like type class\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-ToGraph.html Algebra.Graph.ToGraph>.\n\nThe type classes defined in\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-Class.html Algebra.Graph.Class>\nand\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-HigherKinded-Class.html Algebra.Graph.HigherKinded.Class>\ncan be used for polymorphic construction and manipulation of graphs. Also see\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-Fold.html Algebra.Graph.Fold>\nthat defines the Boehm-Berarducci encoding of algebraic graphs.\n\nThis is an experimental library and the API is expected to remain unstable until version 1.0.0.\nPlease consider contributing to the on-going\n<https://github.com/snowleopard/alga/issues discussions on the library API>.";
