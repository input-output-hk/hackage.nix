Supported features are:\n\nEvaluating bezier curves and derivatives, affine transformations on bezier curves, arclength and inverse arclength, intersections between two curves, intersection between a curve and a line, curvature and radius of curvature, finding tangents parallel to a vector, finding inflection points and cusps.\n\nIt also supports polynomial root finding with Bernstein polynomials.\n\nThe module \"Geom2D.CubicBezier\" exports all the cubic bezier functions.  The module \"Geom2D\"\ncontains general 2D geometry functions and transformations.";
