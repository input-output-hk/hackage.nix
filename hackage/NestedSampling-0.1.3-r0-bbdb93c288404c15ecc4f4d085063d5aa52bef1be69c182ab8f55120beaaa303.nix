It generates samples from the posterior\ndistribution but its main purpose is to estimate the\nevidence P(M|D) of the model conditioned on the observed\ndata. More information on Nested Sampling is available\nat <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_sampling_algorithm>.\n\nThe original code can be found at\n<http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/bayesys/sivia/>\nalong with documentation at\n<http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/bayesys/>.\nAn example program called lighthouse.hs is included.\n\nSo far, only the simple demonstration file called mininest.c\nhas been ported. There is a more sophisticated C library\navailable at\n<http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/bayesys/nest/nest.tar.gz>\nbut it has not been ported to Haskell yet.";
