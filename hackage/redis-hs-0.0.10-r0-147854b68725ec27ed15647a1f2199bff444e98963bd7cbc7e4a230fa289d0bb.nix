It is a developer pre-\nrelease, so it lacks many of the features of the existing `redis` package\n(including a monad wrapper, custom state management, and custom concurrency\nmanagement) but for ordinary tasks, this library makes using Redis very\nstraightforward.\n\nThe feature set is incomplete, with a full command set, test coverage, and\ndocumentation planned for version 0.1.";
