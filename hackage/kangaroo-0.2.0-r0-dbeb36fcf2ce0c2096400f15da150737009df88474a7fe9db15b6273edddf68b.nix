Parsing proceeds by moving a cursor\naround, the array is left intact. This allows _jumping_\ninside the file and contrasts with other parser\ncombinators that progress via consuming input.\n\n\\* Caveat \\* - the above of course means that the target file\nis obliged to be small enough to fit into memory.\n\n\\*\\* MAJOR CAVEAT \\*\\* - kangaroo is somewhat half-baked at the\nmoment - the parsing machinery seems good but the combinators\nand primitive parsers need more work. I\\'ve only released it on\nHackage because I'm now using it with Hurdle which was already\non Hackage.\n\nCurrently kangaroo is twinned with its own library of formatting\ncombinators, at some point this is likely to be put into its\nown package\n\nChangelog:\n\n0.2.0 Changes to ParseMonad - parsing within a region simplified,\ntemporarily added JoinPrint.\n\n0.1.0 First version.\n";
