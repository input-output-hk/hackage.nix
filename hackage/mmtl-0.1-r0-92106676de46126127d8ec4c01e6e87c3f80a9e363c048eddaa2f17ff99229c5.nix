It provides a uniform lifting of\noperations through any monad transformer.\nKnown differences with mtl:\n- It provides a uniform lifting of operations for\nany monad transformer.\n- It does not provide a RWS monad (but you can build it yourself ;)\n- The class MonadTrans requires a new member function tmap.\n- The lifting of callCC through StateT coincides with\nthe lifting in MonadLib, but not with the lifting in mtl.";
