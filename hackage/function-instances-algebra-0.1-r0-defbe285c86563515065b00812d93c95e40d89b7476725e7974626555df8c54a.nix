An instance for Additive already comes with the\noriginal package.\n\nIf @a@ has an instance for one of the classes, then @(k -> a)@ has too.\nThe instances do what you would expect. Values become constant functions:\n\n@\nzero = const zero\n@\n\nUnary functions are composed:\n\n@\nsin f = sin . f\n@\n\nBinary functions fan out the input and combine both results:\n\n@\nf + g = \\\\x -> f x + g x\n@\n\nYou can either import them separately or import @Data.Function.Instances.Algebra@ to\nget them all at once.";
