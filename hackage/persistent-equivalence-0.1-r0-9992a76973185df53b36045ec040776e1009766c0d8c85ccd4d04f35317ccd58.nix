It exhibits optimal performance\nwhen used in a linear pattern, but degrades when other\naccess patterns are used.\n\nThe basic idea is as given by Conchon and Filliatre in\ntheir 2007 paper \"A persistent union-find data structure.\"\nUnlike the implementation given in the paper, this version\nis safe with multiple threads, but does not optimize\nfor backtracking.";
