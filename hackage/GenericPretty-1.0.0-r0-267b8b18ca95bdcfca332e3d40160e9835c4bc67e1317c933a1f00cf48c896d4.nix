The changes from the original paper on the ghc implementation\nare described here: <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Generics#Changes_from_the_paper>.\n\nFor more info and examples of usage please see the README file included  in the package\nand the API at <http://haggismcmutton.github.com/GenericPretty/>";
