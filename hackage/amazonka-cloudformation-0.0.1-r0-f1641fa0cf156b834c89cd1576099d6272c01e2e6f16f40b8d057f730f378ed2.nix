CloudFormation takes\ncare of this for you. After the AWS resources are deployed, you can\nmodify and update them in a controlled and predictable way, in effect\napplying version control to your AWS infrastructure the same way you do\nwith your software.\n\n/See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\n\n/Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under\nheavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!";
