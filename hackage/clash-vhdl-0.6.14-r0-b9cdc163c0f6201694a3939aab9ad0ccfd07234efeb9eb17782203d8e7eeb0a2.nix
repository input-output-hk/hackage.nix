      description = "CλaSH (pronounced ‘clash’) is a functional hardware description language that\nborrows both its syntax and semantics from the functional programming language\nHaskell. The CλaSH compiler transforms these high-level descriptions to\nlow-level synthesizable VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.\n\nFeatures of CλaSH:\n\n* Strongly typed (like VHDL), yet with a very high degree of type inference,\nenabling both safe and fast prototying using consise descriptions (like\nVerilog).\n\n* Interactive REPL: load your designs in an interpreter and easily test all\nyour component without needing to setup a test bench.\n\n* Higher-order functions, with type inference, result in designs that are\nfully parametric by default.\n\n* Synchronous sequential circuit design based on streams of values, called\n@Signal@s, lead to natural descriptions of feedback loops.\n\n* Support for multiple clock domains, with type safe clock domain crossing.\n\n\nThis package provides:\n\n* VHDL Backend";
