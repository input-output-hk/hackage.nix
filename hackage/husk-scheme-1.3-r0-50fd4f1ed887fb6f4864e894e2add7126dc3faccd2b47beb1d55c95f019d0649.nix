In addition, by closely\nfollowing the R5RS standard the intent is to develop a Scheme\nthat is as compatible as possible with other R5RS Schemes.\nThis package includes a stand-alone executable as well as\na library that allows an interpreter to be embedded within an\nexisting Haskell application.";
