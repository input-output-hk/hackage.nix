      description = "This package provides an implementation of the ideas presented in the paper\n\"Functional Pearl: Implicit Configurations\" by Oleg Kiselyov and\nChung-chieh Shan. However, the API has been modified to use @Rank2Types@ and\n@TypeFamilies@\n\nUsage reduces to using two combinators.\n\n> reify :: a -> (forall s. (Reified s, Reflected s ~ a) => Proxy s -> w) -> w\n> reflect :: Reified s => p s -> Reflected s\n\n> ghci> reify 6 (\\p -> reflect p + reflect p) :: Int\n> 12\n\nThe argument passed along by reify is just a @data Proxy t = Proxy@, so all of the\ninformation needed to reconstruct your value has been moved to the type level.\nThis enables it to be used when constructing instances (See @examples/Monoid.hs@).\n\n/Changes in 0.8/:\n\n* Switched to using type families to avoid a problem where the user could cast\n@Proxy (s a) -> Proxy (s b)@ and get back a values with the wrong type under\nthe API in effect from 0.6. This API yields a much nicer example as well.\n\n* Removed @reflectT@ as it no longer makes sense.\n\n* Added a more advanced example @example/Constraints.hs@ using constraint kinds.\n\n/Changes in 0.7/:\n\n* Uses a much simpler construction where @reify@ now converts a @StablePtr@ to an\n@IntPtr@ and reifies that directly as an integral type rather than serializing\nand storing the StablePtr as a list of bytes as proposed in the original paper.\n\n* Removed @ReifiedStorable@ and @ReifiedNums@.\n\n* Since we have so many fewer classes now, @Data.Reflection.Internal@ was merged back\ninto @Data.Reflection@\n\n/Changes in 0.6/:\n\n* Removed the dependency on multiparameter type classes, functional\ndependencies, and flexible instances, by making @Reifies@ a single\nparameter type class in the same fashion as @ReifiesStorable@.\n\n* Moved the building blocks to @Data.Reflection.Internal@ to reduce API clutter.\n\n* Added @reflectT@\n\n/Changes in 0.5/:\n\n* Generalized the type signatures in reflect to allow you to pass any type\nwith kind @* -> *@ wrapped around the desired type as the phantom type\nargument rather than just a @Proxy@.\n\n/Changes in 0.4/:\n\n* Converted from `Data.Tagged` to using `Data.Proxy` for reflection. This\nreduces the need for helper functions and scoped type variables in user\ncode.";
