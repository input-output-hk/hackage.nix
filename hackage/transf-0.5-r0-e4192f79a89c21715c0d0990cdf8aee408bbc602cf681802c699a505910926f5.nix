      description = "Transf is functional text transformer and interpreter.\nIt scans its input for guard tokens and passes everything between to transformation functions. Transformation functions are composed from a small set of combinators and may perform arbirary Haskell computation. Transf contains a full Haskell interpeter and can even interpret its input as Haskell.\nThe main purpose of Transf is to allow the embedding of Domain-Specific Languages in plain text or Markdown files. For example one could use it with Diagrams as follows:\n> This is my file. Here is an image:\n>\n> ~~~diagram \"A circle!\"\n> circle <> stretchX 2 square\n> ~~~\nTransf can then generate the image, and replace the source in the text file with the name of the actual image. It can also include the source.\n> This is my file. Here is an image:\n>\n> ![A circle](a22b15efb10b.png)\n>\nYou can supply your own file names. In the above example, the file name is a 32-bit hash of the source code.";
