This package however only contains the interface and code written against it must be used with a backend such as @Parallel-Arrows-Multicore@, @Parallel-Arrows-ParMonad@, @Parallel-Arrows-Eden@ in order to have any parallel speedup. This package also contains some parallel skeletons such as variants of parMap and some topology skeletons.\nFor more info see check out the paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02216";
