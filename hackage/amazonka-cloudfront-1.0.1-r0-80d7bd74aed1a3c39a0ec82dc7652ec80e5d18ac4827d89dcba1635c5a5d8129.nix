CloudFront delivers your content through\na worldwide network of edge locations. When an end user requests content\nthat you\\'re serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge\nlocation that provides the lowest latency, so content is delivered with\nthe best possible performance. If the content is already in that edge\nlocation, CloudFront delivers it immediately. If the content is not\ncurrently in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an Amazon\nS3 bucket or an HTTP server (for example, a web server) that you have\nidentified as the source for the definitive version of your content.\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.CloudFront\" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\nto get started.";
