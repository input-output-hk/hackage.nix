Precisely, it incorporates non-adaptive approximation for definite integrals using 128-, 256-, 512- and 1024-point Gaussian quadrature rule.\nFor example, to find the approximation of an integral with a 256-point rule:\n\n> ╭ a\n> │   f(x) dx = nIntegrate256 f a b\n> ╯ b\n\n> > nIntegrate256 (\\x -> x^999) 0 1\n> 9.999999999999887e-4\n\nThe type of a function here is not confined only by Double -> Double, indeed one can use any instance of Fractional:\n\n> > nIntegrate256 (\\x -> x^999 :: Fixed Prec50) 0 1\n> 0.00100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009\n\n128 and 256 rules are given with the accuracy of 50 digits, 512 --- with 35 digits (roughly quad), all of them were computed by myself. 1024-point rule was taken from the Gauss-Legendre Quadrature C\\/C++ library by Pavel Holoborodko (<http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/numerical-methods/numerical-integration/>) and goes with the accuracy of 25 decimal digits (fixed point).";
