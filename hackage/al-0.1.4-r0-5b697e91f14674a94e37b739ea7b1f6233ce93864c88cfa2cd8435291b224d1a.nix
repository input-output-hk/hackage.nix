It'll be embedded in\nfuture releases, soon.\nIn order to build and install \"al\", you'll need to have\npkg-config installed.\nFor Ubuntu users, there might be a bug with pkg-config.\nIf the install fails, consider using @cabal install al\nyour OpenAL setup is located to â€“ you can help find that\nwith @find / -name al.h@.";
