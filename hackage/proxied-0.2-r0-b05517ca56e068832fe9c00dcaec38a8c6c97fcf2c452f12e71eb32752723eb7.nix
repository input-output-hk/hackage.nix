      description = "@proxied@ is a simple library that exports a function to\nconvert constant functions to ones that take a @proxy@\nvalue in the \"Data.Proxied\" module. This is useful for\nretrofiting typeclasses that have functions that return a\nconstant value for any value of a particular type (but\nstill need to consume some value, since one of the\nparameterized types must appear in a typeclass function).\nOften, these functions are given @undefined@ as an\nargument, which might be considered poor design.\n\n@Proxy@, however, does not carry any of the\nerror-throwing risks of @undefined@, so it is much more\npreferable to take @Proxy@ as an argument to a constant\nfunction instead of @undefined@. Unfortunately, @Proxy@\nwas included in @base@ until GHC 7.8, so many of @base@'s\ntypeclasses still contain constant functions that aren't\namenable to passing @Proxy@. @proxied@ addresses this\nissue by providing variants of those typeclass functions\nthat take an explicit @proxy@ value.\n\nThis library also contains the \"Data.Proxyless\" module,\nwhich works in the opposite direction. That is, one can\ntake functions which take @Proxy@ (or @undefined@) as an\nargument and convert them to functions which take no\narguments. This trick relies on the @-XTypeApplications@\nextension, so it is only available with GHC 8.0 or later.";
