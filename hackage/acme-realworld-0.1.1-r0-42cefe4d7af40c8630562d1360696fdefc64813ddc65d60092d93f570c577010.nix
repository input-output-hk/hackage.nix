This provides a way to \\\"undo\\\" certain types of side\neffects in the IO monad:\n\n>import Acme.Missiles\n>import Acme.RealWorld\n>\n>main :: IO ()\n>main = do\n>    -- Save the current state of the universe\n>    world_as_we_know_it <- getWorld\n>\n>    -- Cause serious international side effects\n>    launchMissiles\n>\n>    -- After realizing that was a terrible, terrible mistake, restore the\n>    -- pre-war state of the universe.\n>    putWorld world_as_we_know_it";
