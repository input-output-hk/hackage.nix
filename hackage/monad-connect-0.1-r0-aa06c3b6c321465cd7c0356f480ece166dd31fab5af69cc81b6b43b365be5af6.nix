      description = "This library is a basic monadic wrapper over the @connection@ package. It\nprovides a monad transformer which gives your monad stack the ability to\nmaintain a single TCP connection, possibly over TLS and/or SOCKS.\n\nThis is very convenient for simple client applications which connect to a\nsingle server, but it is /not/ enough for robust applications which want to\nautomatically reconnect on errors. In the latter case, a reconnection and\nerror handling layer can be added on top of the simple transformer provided\nhere.";
