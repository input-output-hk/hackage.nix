Naturally, this can be used with -XDeriveGeneric to not     have to write any boilerplate code. This differs from binary-generic which\nrelies on the Data class instead and doesn't seem to have quite the same\nimplementation philosophy. Once Ghc 7.2 is stable, this could be combined\ninto the binary package to provide a sensible default for the Binary class.";
