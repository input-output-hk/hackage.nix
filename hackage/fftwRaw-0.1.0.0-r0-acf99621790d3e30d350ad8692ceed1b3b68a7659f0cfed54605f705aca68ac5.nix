Raise an Issue on Github if you need something I haven't implemented.\n\nUnlike the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fft fft> package, this package provides low level manipulation of FFTW plans (such as `fftw_plan_dft_1d`).\n\nUnlike the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-fftw vector-fftw> package, this package is based on pointers instead of the Vector datatype and it avoids copying the input arrays by assuming that the pointers are aligned as FFTW expects.";
