Because @lens-family@ accords as\nfar as possible, with @Control.Lens@, within its more limited sphere,\na change of imports will often be all that is necessary to begin using them.\n\nIt is rarely necessary to exceed the materials exported here when using\nthe lenses and lensish operations exported by e.g.\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-bytestring pipes-bytestring>\nor <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-group pipes-group>. It is for such\nuse-cases that this module is principally intended.\n\nNote that many of the other lenses and combinators are a bit more\nspecialized than their @Control.Lens@ equivalents:\nfor example, _1 and _2 are here\nfamiliarly specialized to act just on real Haskell\npairs; with the loss of abstraction we also of course\nlose the concomitant opaque error messages\nabout @Field1 s t a b@ etc.";
