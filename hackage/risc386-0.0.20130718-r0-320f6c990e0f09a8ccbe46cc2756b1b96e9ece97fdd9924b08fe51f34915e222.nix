Its purpose is\nto debug the output of a MiniJava compiler (from Andrew Appel's\nbook, Modern Compiler Implementation in JAVA) before register\nallocation has been performed.\n\nrisc386 supports only a small fragment of i386 instructions.\nIt expects its input to be a list of procedures in .intel_syntax\neach of which is started by a label and terminated by a return\nstatement.\n\nControl flow is restricted, so, only jumps to procedure-local\nlabels are allowed.  Reading from an uninitialized memory location\nwill lead to an exception.";
