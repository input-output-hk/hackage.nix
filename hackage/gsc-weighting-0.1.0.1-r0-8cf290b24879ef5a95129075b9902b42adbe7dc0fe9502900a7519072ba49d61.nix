Although\ntheir method was developed for protein sequences, it is readily\nextended to work on any measurable set.\n\nThis package calculates GSC weights for any reasonable\ndendrogram.  If you want to recreate their algorithm, then just\nuse @UPGMA@ as linkage and residue identity as distance\nfunction when creating the dendrogram.";
