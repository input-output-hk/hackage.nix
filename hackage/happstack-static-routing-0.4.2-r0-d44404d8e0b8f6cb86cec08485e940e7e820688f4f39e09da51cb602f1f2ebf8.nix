The new handler might not fire because it matches\nagainst a URL that is already handled earlier.  Or if you put your\nnew handler first, it might steal requests from existing handlers.\nThis Happstack support library allows you to detect overlap cases\nand build unambiguous routing tables where the order of the handlers\nis irrelevant.";
