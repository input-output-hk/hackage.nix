      description = "This package provides an implementation of the ideas presented in the paper\n\"Functional Pearl: Implicit Configurations\" by Oleg Kiselyov and\nChung-chieh Shan. However, the API has been modified to use only\none extension: @Rank2Types@\n\nUsage reduces to using two combinators.\n\n> reify :: a -> (forall s. Reified s => Proxy (s a) -> w) -> w\n> reflect :: Reified s => p (s a) -> a\n\n> ghci> reify 6 (\\p -> reflect p + reflect p)\n> 12\n\nThe argument passed along by reify is just a @data Proxy t = Proxy@, so all of the\ninformation needed to reconstruct your value has been moved to the type level.\nThis enables it to be used when constructing instances (See @examples/Monoid.hs@).\nAn additional combinator that may be more useful when building instances is also\nsupplied.\n\n> reflectT :: Reified s => p s a -> a\n\n/Changes in 0.7/:\n\n* Uses a much simpler construction where @reify@ now converts a @StablePtr@ to an\n@IntPtr@ and reifies that directly as an integral type rather than serializing\nand storing the StablePtr as a list of bytes as proposed in the original paper.\n\n* Removed @ReifiedStorable@ and @ReifiedNums@.\n\n* Since we have so many fewer classes now, @Data.Reflection.Internal@ was merged back\ninto @Data.Reflection@\n\n/Changes in 0.6/:\n\n* Removed the dependency on multiparameter type classes, functional\ndependencies, and flexible instances, by making @Reifies@ a single\nparameter type class in the same fashion as @ReifiesStorable@.\n\n* Moved the building blocks to @Data.Reflection.Internal@ to reduce API clutter.\n\n* Added @reflectT@\n\n/Changes in 0.5/:\n\n* Generalized the type signatures in reflect to allow you to pass any type\nwith kind @* -> *@ wrapped around the desired type as the phantom type\nargument rather than just a @Proxy@.\n\n/Changes in 0.4/:\n\n* Converted from `Data.Tagged` to using `Data.Proxy` for reflection. This\nreduces the need for helper functions and scoped type variables in user\ncode.";
