Primitive types and functions for HTTP (requests, responses, cookies,\npost/query parameters, etc)\n\n2. Type aliases and helper functions for Iteratee I/O\n\n3. A monad for programming web handlers called \\\"Snap\\\", which allows:\n\n* Stateful access to the HTTP request and response objects\n\n* Monadic failure (i.e. MonadPlus/Alternative instances) for declining\nto handle requests and chaining handlers together\n\n* Early termination of the computation if you know early what you want\nto return and want to prevent further monadic processing\n\n/Quick start/: The 'Snap' monad and HTTP definitions are in \"Snap.Core\",\nsome iteratee utilities are in \"Snap.Iteratee\".";
