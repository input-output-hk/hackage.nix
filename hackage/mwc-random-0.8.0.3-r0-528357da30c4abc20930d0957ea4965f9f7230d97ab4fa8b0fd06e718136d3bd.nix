The\ngenerated numbers are suitable for use in statistical applications.\n\nThe uniform PRNG uses Marsaglia's MWC256 (also known as MWC8222)\nmultiply-with-carry generator, which has a period of 2^8222 and\nfares well in tests of randomness.  It is also extremely fast,\nbetween 2 and 3 times faster than the Mersenne Twister.\n\nCompared to the mersenne-random package, this package has a more\nconvenient API, is faster, and supports more statistical\ndistributions.";
