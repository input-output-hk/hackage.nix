The goal is to define problems at a level\nsimilar to other \"algebraic modeling languages\", but retain some\nof the safety and flexibility available in haskell.\n\nRefer to @examples/Test1.hs@ for an example where the derivatives\nare computed by hand, @Test2.hs@ for the use of\n'createIpoptProblemAD' and @Test3.hs@ for the highest level.\n\nCurrent limitations include:\n\n* copying in every iteration happens between between\n\"Data.Vector.Storable\" and \"Data.Vector\" might be avoidable\nsomehow.  Currently it is done because AD needs a Traversable\nstructure, but Storable vectors are not traversable.\n\n* sparseness of derivatives isn't used to decide which way to calculate (forward vs. backward mode)\n\n* probably doesn't work if @IpStdCInterface.h@ has Number =/= 'CDouble'\n\n* no binding to SetIntermediateCallback\n\n* garbage collection of 'IpProblem' won't free C-side resources";
