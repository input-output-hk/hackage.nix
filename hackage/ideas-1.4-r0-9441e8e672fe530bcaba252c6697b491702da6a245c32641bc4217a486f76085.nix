The project's goal is to use software and compiler technology to\nbuild state-of-the-art components for intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) and\nlearning environments. The 'ideas' software package provides a generic\nframework for constructing the expert knowledge module (also known as a\ndomain reasoner) for an ITS or learning environment. Domain knowledge is\noffered as a set of feedback services that are used by external tools such\nas the digital mathematical environment (DME), MathDox, and the Math-Bridge\nsystem. We have developed several domain reasoners based on this framework,\nincluding reasoners for mathematics, linear algebra, logic, learning Haskell\n(the Ask-Elle programming tutor) and evaluating Haskell expressions, and for\npracticing communication skills (the serious game Communicate!).";
