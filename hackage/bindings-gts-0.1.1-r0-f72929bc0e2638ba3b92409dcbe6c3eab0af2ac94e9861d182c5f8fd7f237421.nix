Like GObject,\nit's not useful by itself, but as a foundation for other\nlibraries making use of its type system.\n\nNOTE: these bindings were not made by the author(s) of GTS\nso please don't bug them about issues with the bindings! Any\nerrors in these bindings are my responsibility not that of\nthe GTS team.\n\nChangelog:\n\n[0.0.1] Initial version.\n\n[0.0.2] Improved documentation; added some missing functions;\nfixed a function name; bumped version of base to >=4\n\n[0.0.3] Adding missing GTS enumeration for CSG boolean\noperations; added some more missing functions; fixed some bad\nFunPtr references; added some helper methods, added missing\nGTS_inline.h header to sdist archive\n\n[0.1.1] Bindings reorganized by Maur√≠cio Antunes, author\nof Bindings-DSL. Bindings much improved as a result. This\nis an incompatible API change but should be the last change\nto the package organization. Should now cover all of the GTS\nlibrary. Some features (GSList etc) moved into Bindings-GLib\n(<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bindings-glib>)\nas they should be there.\n";
