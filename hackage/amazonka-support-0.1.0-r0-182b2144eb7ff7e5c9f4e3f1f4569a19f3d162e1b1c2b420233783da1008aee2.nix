The service helps customers get the most\nfrom the products and features provided by Amazon Web Services. There are\nfour levels, or tiers, of AWS Support: Basic, Developer, Business, and\nEnterprise. The Basic tier is free of charge and offers support for account\nand billing questions and service limit increases. The other tiers offer an\nunlimited number of technical support cases with pay-by-the-month pricing and\nno long-term contracts, providing developers and businesses flexibility to\nchoose the level of support that meets their needs.\n\n/See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\n\n/Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under\nheavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!";
