The basic API\nis straightforward: the monad supports forking\nand simple communication in terms of 'IVar's.\nThe library comes with an efficient work-stealing\nimplementation, but the internals are also\nexposed so that you can build your own scheduler\nif necessary.\nExamples of use can be found in the examples/ directory\nof the source package.";
