It is useful for programmers who wish\nto use dependently typed programming techniques. The library was originally\npresented in /Dependently Typed Programming with Singletons/, published\nat the Haskell Symposium, 2012.\n(<http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf>)\nAs of this release date, Haddock was not able to properly process the code\nand produce documentation. Hence, all of the documentation is in the\nREADME file distributed with the package. This README is also accessible\nfrom the project home page.";
