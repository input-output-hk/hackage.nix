Operations requiring\nnon-Haskell 2010 language extensions have been split\ninto a separate package.\nThe difference between this package and the many\nothers on Hackage implementing type-level\nnaturals is its emphasis on simplicity.  It only\nsupports non-negative natural numbers, and only\nthe successor and predicessor operations.  It\nrepresents natural numbers using a type-level\nlinked list, so it is not intended to be used for\nrepresenting large numbers.  Pre-defined aliases\nfor natural numbers up to 15 are provided.\nThe code for this package was largely inspired by\nthe type-level natural numbers in the excellent\nVec package.";
