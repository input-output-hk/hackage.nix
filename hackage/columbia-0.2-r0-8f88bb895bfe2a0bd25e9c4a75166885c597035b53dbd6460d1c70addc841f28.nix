If it is really needed, it is available in one of the old versions.\n\nRelease notes for version 0.1.1:\n\n* Changed the invariant surrounding how files are seeked for reading/writing procedures. This permits an additional optimization. See Utils module for details.\n\n* Generalized the interface to Utils locking strategies to arbitrary monads incorporating exceptions and I/O.\n\nRelease notes for version 0.1.2:\n\n* Minor bug fixes.\n\nRelease notes for version 0.1.3:\n\n* Implemented additional functions specifically for handling dictionaries ('Map's).\n\n* Added basic theory.";
