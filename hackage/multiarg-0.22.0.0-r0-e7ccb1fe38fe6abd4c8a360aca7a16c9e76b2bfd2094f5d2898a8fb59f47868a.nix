      description = "multiarg is a parser combinator library to build command\nline parsers. With it you can easily create parsers with options\nthat take more than one option argument--for example, I created\nmultiarg due to the apparent lack of such ability amongst other\nparsers. Its basic design is loosely inspired by Parsec.\n\nProvides Parser, a monad you use to build parsers. This monad exposes\nmultiarg's full functionality. The library also has a simple,\npre-built parser built with the underlying combinators, which works\nfor many situtations and shields you from the underlying complexity\nif you don't need it.\n\nSee the documentation in the System.Console.MultiArg module for\ndetails.";
