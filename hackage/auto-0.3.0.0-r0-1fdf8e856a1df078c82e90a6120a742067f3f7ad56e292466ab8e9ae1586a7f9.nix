It is suited for any domain where either\nthe input or the output can be described as a stream of\nvalues: a stream of input events, output views, etc.\n\n/auto/ works by providing a type that encapsulates\n\"value stream transformers\", or locally stateful\nfunctions; by specifying your program as a (potentially\ncyclic) graph of relationships between value streams, you\ncreate a way of \"declaring\" a system based simply on\nstatic relationships between quantities.\n\nInstead of a \"state monad\" type solution, where all\nfunctions have access to a global state, /auto/ works by\nspecifying relationships which each exist independently\nand on their own, without any global state.\n\nA more fuller exposition is in the `README.md`, in this\nproject directory and also online at\n<https://github.com/mstksg/auto/blob/master/README.md>;\nyou can get started by reading the tutorial, which is\nalso in this project directory in the `tutorial`\ndirectory, and also incidentally online at\n<https://github.com/mstksg/auto/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.md>.\nAlso, check out the\n<https://github.com/mstksg/auto-examples auto-examples>\nrepository on github for plenty of real-world and toy\nexamples to learn from!\n\nSupport available on freenode's #haskell-auto,\n#haskell-game, and also on the github issue\ntracker for the source repository.\n\nImport \"Control.Auto\" to begin!";
