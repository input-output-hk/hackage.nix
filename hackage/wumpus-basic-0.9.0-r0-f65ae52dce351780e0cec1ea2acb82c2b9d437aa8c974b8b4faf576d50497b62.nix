      description = "\n\\*\\* WARNING \\*\\* - this package is sub-alpha. It was released\nto Hackage prematurely - designing a higher-level drawing\nlibrary turns out to be much more demanding than designing a\nlow-level one (Wumpus-Core).\n\nA few of the modules (SafeFonts, SVGColours, X11Colours) are\nfairly stable others simply aren\\'t and may even disappear in\nsubsequent updates.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n0.8.0 to 0.9.0:\n\n* Re-worked @Basic.Text.LRSymbol@ changed the type name and the\ntypes of the run functions. Added more symbols and a new demo\n@Symbols.hs@.\n\n* @ScalingContext@ added to @Basic.Graphic@. Changed\n@monoTextWidth@ to take a character count, the old behaviour\nis recreated by the new function @monoTextLength@.\n\n* @Basic.Graphic.Chain@ removed. It is now superseded by\n@Basic.Chains@.\n\n* Added new property to @DrawingContext@ for line spacing\nscaling factor, and added a new drawing primitive\n@textlineMulti@ for multi-line, left justified labels.\n\n* Synthezied attribute /getters/ such as @textDimensions@ moved\nfrom @Basic.Graphic.DrawingContext@ to the new module\n@Basic.Graphic.Query@. The type of all the functions has\nchanged to DrawingF. @lowerxHeight@ is renamed\n@monoLowerxHeight@ emphasizing that the metrics pertain to\nmonospaced Courier font.\n\n* Added Shapes modules.\n\n* TurtleMonad module - the TurtleDrawing type and run functions\nhave been removed and the internals have been reworked.\nTurtle is now run solely as a /local effect/ within the\nDrawing monad.\n\n0.7.0 to 0.8.0:\n\n* Re-introduced LRText and LRSymbol - they now work with\nWumpus-Core\\'s kerning support.\n\n* Changes to @Graphic.Basic.BaseTypes@ - @DrawingObject@\nrenamed to @DrawingF@. @HPrim@ wrapped as a newtype to\nsupport a Monoid instance. Removed @appendGraphic@ and @gcat@\nas they can be achieved with @mappend@ and @mconcat@.\n@appendAt@ renamed to @lgappend@. @PointT@ remaned to\n@PointF@.\n\n* Changes to @Graphic.Basic.Drawing@ - @drawAt@, @drawAtImg@,\n@drawConn@, @drawConnImg@ all removed. They are replaced\nby @draw@ and @drawi@ together with then new @at@ and @conn@\ncombinators.\n\n* Changes to @Basic.Graphic.PrimGraphic@ - @localDrawingContext@\nrenamed to @localLG@ and moved to @Basic.Graphic.BaseTypes@.\n\n* Updates to @Basic.SafeFonts@ to work with changes to\n@Wumpus.Core@.\n\n";
