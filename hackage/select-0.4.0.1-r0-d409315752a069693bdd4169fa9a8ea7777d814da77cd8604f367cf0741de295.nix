This package provides an interface to that system call.\n\nChanged in version 0.4.0.1:\n\n* Minor internal cleanups.\n\n* TODO moved to file.\n\nChanges in version 0.4:\n\n* Introduce an interface to @fd_set@.\n\n* Add functions with various amounts of abstraction; in particular, 'select'''\nmatches 'select' in previous versions.\n\n* Retry @select(2)@ in case of interruption by signals.\n\n* Remove dependence on the vector package.\n\nWARNINGS:\n\n* Behavior with write and exception file descriptors is under-tested.\nFeedback is welcome.\n\n* This package is far from complete, and should be tested throughly before being relied upon.\n\n/NOTE/: I feel I'm occupying prime namespace realestate with a package name\nlike select. I'll happily let myself be chased away if someone more qualified wants\nto use this package name. Let me know.";
