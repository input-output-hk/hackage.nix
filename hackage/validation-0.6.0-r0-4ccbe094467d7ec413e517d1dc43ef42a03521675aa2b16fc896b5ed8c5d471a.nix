That is to say, if two\n(or more) errors are encountered, they are appended using a `Semigroup`\noperation.\n\nAs a consequence of this `Applicative` instance, there is no corresponding\n`Bind` or `Monad` instance. `AccValidation` is an example of, \"An applicative\nfunctor that is not a monad.\"";
