We have put a lot of effort to\nmake sure that the benchmarks are correct, fair and reproducible.  Please\nreport if you find something that is not right.\n\nIf you are using @stack@ then use @./run.sh@ to run the benchmarks;\ncharts will be generated in the `charts` directory.\n\nWith any build tool, run the benchmarks with\n@--csv=results.csv@ as arguments and then use @makecharts results.csv@ to\ncreate the charts. In case you want to be pedantic about accurate results\nthen you can run the benchmarks in the same way as @run.sh@ invokes them.";
