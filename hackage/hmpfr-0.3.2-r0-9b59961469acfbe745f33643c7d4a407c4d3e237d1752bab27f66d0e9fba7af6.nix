This version is compatible\nwith MPFR 2.4.* and later and will not work with previous releases\nof the MPFR library.\n\n/Since MPFR uses GMP, this library does not work correctly/\n/with a ghc that has been compiled with integer-gmp./\n/When using ghc, this library will require that the ghc/\n/is compiled  with integer-simple./\n\nThe library includes a mutable interface\nin addition to the pure one. These functions should have a\nlot less overhead than the pure ones.\n\nSome simple examples of usage can be found in demo/Demo.hs.";
