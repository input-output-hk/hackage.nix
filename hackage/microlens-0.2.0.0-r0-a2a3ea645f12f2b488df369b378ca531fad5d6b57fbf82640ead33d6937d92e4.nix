It is compatible with lens, and should have same performance. It also has better documentation.\n\nUse this library:\n\n* if you want to define lenses or traversals in your own library, but don't want to depend on lens\n\n* if you are new to lenses and want a small library to play with, but don't want to use something “inferior” or have to relearn things when/if you switch to lens\n\nDon't use this library:\n\n* if you need @Iso@s, @Prism@s, indexed traversals, or actually anything else which isn't defined here\n\n* if you think lenses compose “in the wrong order” (in which case you're looking for <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fclabels fclabels>)\n\nNote that microlens has /no/ dependencies starting from GHC 7.10 (base-4.8). Prior to that, it has to depend on transformers-0.2 or above.\n\nAlso note that it's not done yet and there's a lot of things missing.";
