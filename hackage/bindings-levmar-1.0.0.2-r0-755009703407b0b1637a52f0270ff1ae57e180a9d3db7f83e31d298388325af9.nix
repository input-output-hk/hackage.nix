      description = "See the @levmar@ package for a high-level wrapper\naround this package.\n\nThe Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is an iterative\ntechnique that finds a local minimum of a function that\nis expressed as the sum of squares of nonlinear\nfunctions. It has become a standard technique for\nnonlinear least-squares problems and can be thought of\nas a combination of steepest descent and the\nGauss-Newton method. When the current solution is far\nfrom the correct one, the algorithm behaves like a\nsteepest descent method: slow, but guaranteed to\nconverge. When the current solution is close to the\ncorrect solution, it becomes a Gauss-Newton method.\n\nBoth unconstrained and constrained (under linear\nequations and box constraints) Levenberg-Marquardt\nvariants are included.  All functions have Double and\nFloat variants.\n\nSee: <http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/>\n\nNote that the included C library is lightly patched to\nmake it pure. This way the functions can be used inside\n@unsafePerformIO@.\n\nA note regarding the license:\n\nAll files EXCEPT those in the levmar-2.4 directory fall\nunder the BSD3 license. The levmar C library, which is\nbundled with this binding, falls under the GPL. If you\nbuild a program which is linked with this binding then\nit is also linked with levmar. This means such a\nprogram can only by distributed under the terms of the\nGPL.";
