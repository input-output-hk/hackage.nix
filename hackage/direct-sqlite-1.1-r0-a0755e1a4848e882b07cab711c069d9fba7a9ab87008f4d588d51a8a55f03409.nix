It is not as complete as bindings-sqlite3,\nbut is slightly higher-level, in that it supports marshalling of data values to and\nfrom the database.  In particular, it supports strings encoded as UTF8, and BLOBs\nrepresented as ByteStrings.\nVersion 1.1 adds the SQLite amalgamation file (version 3.7.5) to the project, so that\nthere are no external dependencies.";
