      description = "\nWumpus is a kernel library for generating 2D vector pictures,\nits salient feature is portability due to no FFI dependencies.\nIt can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG files. The\ngenerated PostScript code is plain [1] and reasonably\nefficient as the use of stack operations, i.e @gsave@ and\n@grestore@, is minimized.\n\nPictures in Wumpus are made from /paths/ and text /labels/.\nPaths themselves are made from points. The usual affine\ntransformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be\napplied to Pictures. Unlike PostScript there is no\nnotion of a current point, Wumpus builds pictures in a\ncoordinate-free style.\n\nGENERAL DRAWBACKS...\n\nFor actually drawing pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus is very\nlow level. There is a supplemantary package @wumpus-basic@\navailable that helps create certain types of diagram, but it is\nexperimental - functionality is added an dropped between\nreleases.\n\nSome of the design decisions made for wumpus-core are not\nsophisticated (e.g. how attributes like colour are handled,\nand how the bounding boxes of text labels are calculated), so\nWumpus might be limited compared to other systems. However,\nthe design permits a fairly simple implementation, which is a\npriority.\n\n\\[1\\] Because the output is simple, straight-line PostScript\ncode, it is possible to use GraphicsMagick or a similar tool\nto convert Wumpus'\\s EPS files to many other formats\n(bitmaps).\n\nChangelog:\n\n0.31.0 to 0.32.0:\n\n* Major API changes to @Core.Picture@ for XML hyperlinks.\nHyperlinks now group one-or-more Primitives (path or label),\ninstead of being attached to a single Primitive. This better\ncorresponds with XML but it has made the Picture type more\ncomplicated, and has mandated significant changes to the\nPicture API. All the hyperlink variants of the Primitive\nconstructors have been removed (xcstroke, xfill, xtextlabel,\n...), and hyperlinks are now created with @xlinkGroup@.\n\n* The type signatures for the /primitive/ constructors (fill,\ncstroke, textlabel, ...) in the Picture API have changed and\nare now more complicated as there is an extra layer of\nindirection in the type hierarchy.\n\n* The primitive constructors for filled and stroked paths and\nellipses have been renamed: @bordered@ is now @fillStroke@,\n@borderedEllipse@ is now @fillStrokeEllipse@.\n\n* @Core.FontSize@ - the arguments to the function @textBounds@\nhave been changed to take the String in question, rather than\nits precomputed length. The size of the string is then\ncalculated with the new function @charCount@ which takes into\naccount escaped characters.\n\n* Added @yellow@, @cyan@ and @magenta@ to the predefined\ncolours in @Core.Colour@.\n\n0.30.0 to 0.31.0:\n\n* Extended the label type to optionally handle horizontal\nor vertical \\\"kerning\\\". This can be efficiently implemented\nin SVG.\n\n* Major API change - the Primitive constructors defined in\n@Core.PictureLanguage@ are no longer overloaded (@cstroke@,\n@ostroke@, @fill@, @textlabel@, @ellipse@). The respective\nclasses (@Stroke@, @TextLabel@, @Ellipse@) have been removed\nand the constructors now have monomorphic types. This is\nbecause Wumpus-Core now only has one colour type and stroke\nattributes are now a single type, so polymorphism became\nless useful (and the simplicity of monomorphic types became\nmore favourable). @ellipse@ is no longer a constructor\ninstead there variants @fillEllipse@ and @strokeEllipse@.\n\n* Added support for /bordered/ closed paths - i.e. paths that\nare both stroked and filled. These can be efficiently drawn\nin SVG with a single @path@ element.\n\n* Changed StrokeAttr representation to be a regular data type\nrather than a list of /deltas/ - i.e. differences to the\ngraphics state.\n\n* Added SVG font attribute /delta optimizations/ to help reduce\nSVG code size - via the @fontDeltaContext@ function in\n@Core.Picture@. This functionality was partially inplemented\nin the last release using the @GSUpdate@ datatype - this\ndatatype it is now called @FontCtx@.\n\n* Some internal work documenting text encoding.\n\n0.23.0 to 0.30.0:\n\n* Substantial changes - the output machinery has been heavily\nmodified, the intention was to reduce the use of matrix\ntransformations in SVG output. Though this goal has not been\nachieved, some code-size improvements in the SVG output have\nbeen made.\n\n* The code generation monads have been changed - Wumpus no\nlonger uses a writer monad for code generation, but it will\nkeep the Wumpus name.\n\n* Added support for hyperlinks in the SVG output.\n\n* Improved internal pretty printing and added the function\n@printPicture@ for debugging.\n\n* The @Core.Colour@ module has been simplified to support just\none (new) type - RGBi, and the conversion type class\n@PSColour@ has been eliminated.\n\n* @Core.Picture@ - the type of the @frame@ function has been\nchanged to take a list of Primitives rather than a single\nPrimitive. The function @frameMulti@ which previously\nprovided this functionality has been removed. SVG hyperlinks\nare now supported for Primitives.\n\n* The default font size has been changed to 14 pt.\n\n* The Path datatype has been renamed PrimPath, likewise Ellipse\nis now PrimEllispe and Label becomes PrimLabel.\n\n* @Core.Geometry@ now longer defines an affine frame datatype.\n\n* @Core.BoundingBox@ module changed significantly. The corner\nfunctions (@boundaryBottomLeft@, etc.) have been removed,\nalong with the plane functions (@leftPlane@, etc.). Some\nfunctions have been given more verbose names - @corners@ is\nnow @boundaryCorners@, @within@ is now @withinBoundary@ and\n@union@ is now @boundaryUnion@.\n\n\n";
