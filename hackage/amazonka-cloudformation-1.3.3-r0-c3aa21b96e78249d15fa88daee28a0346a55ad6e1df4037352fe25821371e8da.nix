AWS CloudFormation helps you\nleverage AWS products such as Amazon EC2, EBS, Amazon SNS, ELB, and Auto\nScaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost effective\napplications without worrying about creating and configuring the\nunderlying AWS infrastructure.\nWith AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and\ndependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of\nresources as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates\nand deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all\ndependencies between the resources for you.\nFor more information about this product, go to the\n<http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/ CloudFormation Product Page>.\nAmazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products. If you need\nadditional technical information about a specific AWS product, you can\nfind the product\\'s technical documentation at\n<http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/>.\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.CloudFormation\" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\nto get started.";
