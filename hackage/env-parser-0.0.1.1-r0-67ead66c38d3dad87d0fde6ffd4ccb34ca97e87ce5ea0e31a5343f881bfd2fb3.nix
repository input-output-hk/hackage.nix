For programs which\ndraw configuration from the environment, however, this must usually be done\nmanually.\n\n@env-parser@ focuses on making ENV-configured programs both easy to build,\ndeclarative, self-documenting, and easy to test.\n\nA particular use case of this parser is to make it easy to build applications\nwhich launch under Heroku-style infrastructure. We provide explicit parsers\nfor some of Heroku's conventions for this purpose.";
