      description = "TV is a library for composing /tangible values/ (\\\"TVs\\\"), i.e., values\nthat carry along external interfaces.  Values and interfaces are\n/combined and separable/, which makes TVs ready to use and to reuse.\n\nIf you just want to /use/ TV, see the main module below\n(\"Interface.TV\").  The other modules (@UI.Graphics.TV.*@) are useful\nfor understanding the implementation and adding new features.\n\nTry out the examples in @src\\/Examples.hs@.\n\nFor more information, including examples, please see the project wiki\npage <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/TV>\n\nThis page and the module documentation pages have links to colorized\nsource code and to wiki pages where you can read and contribute /user\ncomments/.  Enjoy!\n\n&#169; 2007 by Conal Elliott; BSD3 license.";
