Commonly\nfound in version control systems, patches are also a simple example of a group, supporting composition\nand inversion.\n\nThis library provides a pleasant interface for working with patches to vectors with any type of element.\nIt includes patch composition, inversion, and application, as well as a way to compute a patch between\ntwo vectors using the Wagner-Fischer algorithm.";
