A verbosity\nlevel controls the quantity of log messages.\nFor debugging, this logging framework can do double-duty by controlling the\ninterleaving of threads which are producing log messages, for the purpose of\nfuzz-testing concurrent interleavings.  This is accomplished by blocking the\nthreads at the point of each logging message, and controlling the order in\nwhich threads (sequentially) unblock.";
