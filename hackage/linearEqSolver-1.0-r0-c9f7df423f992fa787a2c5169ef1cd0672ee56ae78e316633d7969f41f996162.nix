Or ask for all possible solutions for underspecified\nsystems, which will be lazily returned in a list.\n\nlinearEqSolver is hosted at GitHub: <http://github.com/LeventErkok/linearEqSolver>. Comments,\nbug reports, and patches are always welcome.\n\n\nRelease notes can be seen at: <http://github.com/LeventErkok/linearEqSolver/blob/master/RELEASENOTES>.";
