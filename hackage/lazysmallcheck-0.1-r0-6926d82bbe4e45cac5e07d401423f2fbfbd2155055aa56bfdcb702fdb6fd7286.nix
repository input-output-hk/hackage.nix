It is based on the idea that if a property holds\nfor a partially-defined input then it must also hold for all\nfully-defined instantiations of the that input.  Compared to ``eager''\ninput generation as in SmallCheck, Lazy SmallCheck may require\nsignificantly fewer test-cases to verify a property for all inputs up\nto a given depth.";
