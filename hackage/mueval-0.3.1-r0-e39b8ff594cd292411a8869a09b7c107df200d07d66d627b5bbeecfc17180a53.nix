      description = "Mueval is a Haskell interpreter. It\nuses the GHC API to evaluate arbitrary Haskell expressions.\nImportantly, mueval takes many precautions to defang and avoid \"evil\"\ncode.  It uses resource limits, whitelisted modules,\nspecial Show instances for IO, threads, changes of directory, and so\non to sandbox the Haskell code. (It is much like Lambdabot's famous\nevaluation functionality.)\n\nCurrently there is a major hole in Mueval: it is possible use a function\nwithout importing it, which allows the module whitelisting to be bypassed,\nand hence, unsafePerformIO and its various type-breaking friends can be used\nto do arbitrary things. Mueval uses a blacklist to avoid the most naive and obvious\ndangerous function imports, but this is a very weak mechanism and cannot be relied\nupon.\n\nUntil this hole is fixed, Mueval should *not* be used on potentially hostile input.\n\nMueval is currently POSIX-only.";
