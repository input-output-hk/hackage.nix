      description = "`reflex-jsx` is a library for writing jsx-like syntax in\nreflex code. This can be useful for situations where you\nhave a large block of HTML with some styles, and it would\nbe easier to read as actual HTML than various reflex\nfunctions.\nIt's implemented as a \"QuasiQuoter\", so you just import the\n`jsx` function from ReflexJsx and generate the equivalent\nfunctions that would run inside of a \"MonadWidget t m\".\nNot only can you generate a block of static HTML/CSS, but you\ncan also splice in your own nodes that implement\n\"MonadWidget t m\", string attribute values, or even entire\ndynamic attribute maps.";
