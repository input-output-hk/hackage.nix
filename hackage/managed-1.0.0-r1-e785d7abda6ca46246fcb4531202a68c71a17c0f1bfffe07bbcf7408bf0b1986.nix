This idiom forms a\n@Monad@, which is a special case of the @ContT@ monad (from @transformers@) or\nthe @Codensity@ monad (from @kan-extensions@).  The main purpose behind this\npackage is to provide a restricted form of these monads specialized to this\nunusually common case.\n\nThe reason this package defines a specialized version of these types is to:\n\n* be more beginner-friendly,\n\n* simplify inferred types and error messages, and:\n\n* provide some additional type class instances that would otherwise be orphan\ninstances";
