      description = "The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is an iterative technique that\nfinds a local minimum of a function that is expressed as the sum of\nsquares of nonlinear functions. It has become a standard technique\nfor nonlinear least-squares problems and can be thought of as a\ncombination of steepest descent and the Gauss-Newton method. When\nthe current solution is far from the correct one, the algorithm\nbehaves like a steepest descent method: slow, but guaranteed to\nconverge. When the current solution is close to the correct\nsolution, it becomes a Gauss-Newton method.\n\nOptional box- and linear constraints can be given. Both single and\ndouble precision floating point types are supported.\n\nThe actual algorithm is implemented in a\n<http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/ C library> which is\nbundled with @bindings-levmar@ which this package depends on.\n\nA note regarding the license:\n\nThis library depends on @bindings-levmar@ which is bundled together\nwith a C library which falls under the GPL. Please be aware of this\nwhen distributing programs linked with this library. For details see\nthe description and license of @bindings-levmar@.";
