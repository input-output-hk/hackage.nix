Records can contain mandatory or\noptional fields of any type, subject to a class constraint.\nHeading names and and record construction code are derived using\nTemplate Haskell.\n\nOne use case for this library is parsing records from a CSV file.  A\nparser from CSV to @[[String]]@ is not included, but there are several\nsuitable packages on Hackage.\n\nThe emphasis of this library is on simplicity of use rather than performance.\nIt is likely to be suitable for a hundred thousand rows, but not many\nmillions.  A future version may support packed input formats like\n@ByteString@ or @Text@.  Suggestions and patches are welcome.";
