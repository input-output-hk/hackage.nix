For these applications, the\nimages can be marked as 'Transient' to indicate no further\ninterest in the VM-image itself, and B9 will discard them\nafter the build.\nB9 will never over-write source files, not even large\nvm-image files - there is no intended way to modify a\nsource vm-image file 'in-place'.\nB9 operates in random build directories, which are\ndiscarded when the build exists.";
