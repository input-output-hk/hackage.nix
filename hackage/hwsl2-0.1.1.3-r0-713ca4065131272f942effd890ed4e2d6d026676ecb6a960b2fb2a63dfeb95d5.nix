      description = "An algebraic hash function, inspired by the paper \"Hashing with SL2\" by Tillich and Zemor.\n\nThe hash function is based on matrix multiplication in the special linear group\nof degree 2, over a Galois field of order 2^127,  with all computations modulo\nthe polynomial x^127 + x^63 + 1.\n\nThis construction gives some nice properties, which traditional \"bit-scambling\"\nhash functions don't possess, including it being composable. It holds:\n\n> hash (m1 <> m2) == hash m1 <> hash m2\n\nAll operations in this package are implemented in a very efficient manner using SSE instructions.";
