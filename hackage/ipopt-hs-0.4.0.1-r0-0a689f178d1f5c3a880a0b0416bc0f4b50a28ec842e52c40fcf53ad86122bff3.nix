Bindings to\n<http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt NLopt> are\nalso included.\n\n[@installation@]\nneeds the c library ipopt installed. Also by default a binding to\nnlopt is included. Nlopt by default does not include shared libraries,\nwhich seems to be needed to run things from ghci (ie. you need to\n@./configure --enable-shared@ when buildin nlopt).\n\nA embedded language, similar to the one provided by glpk-hs, is\ndefined in \"Ipopt.NLP\". The goal is to define problems at a level\nsimilar to other \"algebraic modeling languages\", but retain some\nof the safety and flexibility available in haskell. There is some\noverhead <http://code.haskell.org/~aavogt/ipopt-hs/examples/bench.html>\nbut at least on the small 4-variable constrained optimization\nproblem.\n\nCurrent limitations include:\n\n* copying in every iteration happens between between\n\"Data.Vector.Storable\" and \"Data.Vector\" might be avoidable\nsomehow.  Currently it is done because AD needs a Traversable\nstructure, but Storable vectors are not traversable.\n\n* sparseness of derivatives isn't used\n\n* no binding to SetIntermediateCallback";
