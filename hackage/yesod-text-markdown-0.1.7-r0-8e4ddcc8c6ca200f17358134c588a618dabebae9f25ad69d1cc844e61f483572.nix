The main\nadvantages of having Text.Markdown as underlying renderer\nis the much smaller dependencies and the permissiver\nlicense.  See\n<https://github.com/pbrisbin/yesod-markdown> and\n<https://github.com/snoyberg/markdown>.\n\nThis package intentionally tries to be like\nyesod-markdown, so switching between the markdown backends\nshould be easy.\n\nIf you wonder why the haddocks only show a few exports,\nit's because it doesn't show exporting of instances which\nis most of what this package is about.";
