      description = "<<https://github.com/justinethier/husk-scheme/raw/master/docs/husk-scheme.png>>\n\nHusk is a dialect of Scheme written in Haskell that implements a superset of\nthe R5RS standard. Advanced features are provided including:\n\n* First-class continuations of unlimited extent\n\n* Hygienic macros based on syntax-rules\n\n* Low-level explicit renaming macros\n\n* Library syntax from the R7RS standard\n\n* A foreign function interface (FFI) to Haskell\n\n* Full numeric tower providing support for real, rational, and complex numbers\n\n* Proper tail recursion and lexical scoping\n\n* Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) interpreter, with input driven by Haskeline to provide a rich user experience\n\n* Standard library of Scheme functions, and support for many popular SRFI's\n\nHusk may be used as either a stand-alone interpreter or as an extension language within a larger Haskell application. By closely following the R5RS standard, the intent is to develop a Scheme that is as compatible as possible with other R5RS Schemes. Husk is mature enough for use in production, however it is not optimized for performance-critical applications.\n\nScheme is one of two main dialects of Lisp. Scheme follows a minimalist design philosophy: the core language consists of a small number of fundamental forms which may be used to implement other built-in forms. Scheme is an excellent language for writing small, elegant programs, and may also be used to write scripts or embed scripting functionality within a larger application.\n\nFor documentation and examples, see\n<http://justinethier.github.io/husk-scheme/documentation.html>.\n\nFor detailed information on each release, see\n<http://justinethier.github.io/husk-scheme/news.html>.";
