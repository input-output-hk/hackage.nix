      description = "Efficient Matrix operations in 100% Haskell.\n\n[@v0.1@] Initial version, features @det@,\nbasic arithmetic operations, and instances for\n'Float', 'Double', 'Complex', and 'Rational'.\n\n[@v0.1.1@] Fixed wrong algorithm for computing the\ninverse of a 'Matrix'.\n\n[@v0.1.2@] Added instances for @Num Matrix@,\n@Fractional Matrix@, and @Eq Matrix@.\n\n[@v0.1.3@] @inv@ is now a total function and will\nno longer call `error' if a matrix is not\ninvertible. Also @Matrix@ derives 'Data.Typeable'\nnow.\n\n[@v0.1.4@] Added @scale@, and methods for joining\nmatrices vertically and horizontally. Corrected\na bug in @isUnit@ reported by Charles Durham.\n@isUnit@ returned True for any matrix for which\n@all (== 1) . trace@ would have, which is wrong).\n\n[@v0.2@] A little bit more documentation. Also moved some\nfunctions (@isXXX@) away from the type class @MatrixElement@.\nProperly flagged the package as experimental (was\nimproperly marked as @stable@, copied form a\ntemplate).\n\n[@v0.2.1@] Added @cofactors@, @adjugate@, @minor@, and\n@minorMatrix@.\n\n[@v0.2.2@] @rank@ works now for any Matrix component type.\n\n[@v0.2.3@] Added 'Read' instance for @Matrix@.\nImproved on documentation.\n\n[@v0.3@] Added a QuickCheck test suite, fixed a bug in @det@\n(det would crash for singular matrices, where it should\nreturn 0).\n\n[@v0.3.1@] Added TemplateHaskell syntactic sugar (see\n\"Numeric.Matrix.Sugar\"). Rewrote multiplication.\n@matrix@ function build an array faster now.\n\n[@v0.3.2@] Numeric.Matrix.Sugar was not mentioned in the\ncabal file. Improved test suite. Improved documentation.\n\n[@v0.4@] Fixed a bug regarding @empty@ and @fromList@.\nUse unsafe operations where it is safe for speed.\nAdded RULES. Added an instance for binary.\n\n[@v0.4.1@] The unsafe operations used in v0.4 turned out\nto fatally fail on certain platforms. Revoked this\nchange. Thanks to Marcin Fatyga for pointing at the\nissue.";
