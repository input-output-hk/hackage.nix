      description = "A general purpose Reactive Programming (FRP) system intended for \\'industrial strength\\'\napplications. It's a translation of a C++ implementation used for data acquisition, so\nthe design, at least, has had some real-world testing.\n\n* Applicative style: Event implements Functor and Behaviour implements Applicative.\n\n* FRP logic is tied to partitions, within which consistency is guaranteed.\nThis allows you to selectively relax consistency guarantees to facilitate parallelism.\n\n* Instead of the common approach where inputs are fed into the front of a monolithic\n\\'reactimate\\', Sodium allows you to push inputs in from scattered places in IO.\n\n* Integration with IO: Extensible to provide lots of scope for lifting IO into FRP\nlogic.\n\n* Push-based imperative implementation.";
