      description = "Amazon Route 53 is a scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It\nprovides secure and reliable routing to your infrastructure that uses\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud\n(Amazon EC2), Elastic Load Balancing, or Amazon Simple Storage Service\n(Amazon S3). You can also use Amazon Route 53 to route users to your\ninfrastructure outside of AWS.\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.Route53\" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\nto get started.";
