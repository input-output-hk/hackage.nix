      description = "Takusen is a DBMS access library. It has a backend for Oracle on Unix,\nLinux or Windows via OCI, and a stub to test the library without any database.\nThe infrastructure and the stub let one interface natively with other\ndatabases.\nThe distinguished feature of Takusen is processing query results using a\nleft-fold enumerator.  The user supplies an iteratee function, which receives\nrows one-at-a-time from the result-set.  The number of the arguments to the\niteratee is the number of the columns in the result-set, plus the seed. Each\ncolumn in the result-set has its own Haskell type. The latter could be a Maybe\ntype if the particular iteratee wishes to process NULLs.\nThe benefits are: more convenient and intuitive enumeration, iteration, and\naccumulation (see tests for examples); the retrieved data are not merely\nstrings but have Haskell types: Int, Float, Date, etc.; buffer preallocation;\npre-fetching; support for both enumerators and cursors, proper handling of all\nerrors including various IO errors. No unsafe operations are used.";
