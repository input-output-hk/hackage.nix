While at it, I took the\nopportunity to have what @select@ returns put in a 'TMVar'.\n\nThe package has three parts:\n\n[\"System.Posix.IO.Select\"] just wraps @select@.\n\n[\"Control.Concurrent.STM.TMVarIO\"] and \"Control.Concurrent.MVarIO\" put the\nreturn value of IO actions into a 'TMVar' or an 'MVar', respectively.\n\n[\"System.Posix.IO.Select.STM\"] and \"System.Posix.IO.Select.MVar\" do the above for\n@select@.\n\n/NOTE/: I feel I'm occupying prime namespace realestate with a package name\nlike select. I'll happily let myself be chased away if anybody else wants\nto use this package name. Let me know.\n\n/CAVEAT/: I'm not an experienced Haskeller, and this is my first foray into\nFFI in general.";
