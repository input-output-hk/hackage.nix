This package expresses type-level sets and functions as /types/ instead.\n\nInstances are replaced by value-level proofs which can be directly manipulated; this makes quite a bit of (constructive) set theory expressible; for example, we have:\n\n* Subsets and extensional set equality\n\n* Unions (binary or of sets of sets), intersections, cartesian products, powersets, and a sort of dependent sum and product\n\n* Functions and their composition, images, preimages, injectivity\n\nThe proposition-types (derived from the ':=:' equality type) aren't meaningful purely by convention; they relate to the rest of Haskell as follows: A proof of @A :=: B@ gives us a safe coercion operator @A -> B@ (while the logic is inevitably inconsistent /at compile-time/ since 'undefined' proves anything, I think that we still have the property that if the 'Refl' value is successfully pattern-matched, then the two parameters in its type are actually equal).";
