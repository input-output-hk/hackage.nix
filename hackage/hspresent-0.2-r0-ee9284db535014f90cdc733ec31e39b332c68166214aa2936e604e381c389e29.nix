It's extremely\nbasic and unintelligent. Don't expect much.\n\nInvoke like `hspresent /path/to/your/presentation`. Left and right arrow keys\nmove between slides, and hitting `q` or `Ctrl-C` quits the presentation.\n\nThe file format is really simple right now. Slides are separated by lines\nconsisting of the characters `--`. You can put the single character `.` on a\nline to demarcate a split frame. A split frame really creates a new frame with\nthe contents of the previous frame copied at the front (this is similar to how\nbeamer works).";
