Virtual cube can be constructed from the state\nof a physical cube. Support for a two phase algorithm will be given in a future release\nfor cubes of size 3x3x3 to find the smallest number of moves which solve the cube.\nThe Rubik's cube exhibits many non-trival aspects of group theory.\nThe package comes with an executable \"hcube\".\nRefer to the README file for details.";
