The pitch of the sound depends on the position of the last change\non the tape.\n\nThe built-in machines are busy beaver candidates.\nA busy beaver is a Turing machine which, when given an empty tape, does a lot of work, then halts.\nCurrently it is not known whether these simple machines halt or not.";
