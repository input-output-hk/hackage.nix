These can serve as interval\nendpoints.  In a future release also MPFR arbitrary-precision numbers\nwill be made available as interval endpoints.\n\nThis package does not compile with ghc 7.0.* due to a\ncompiler bug that has been fixed for the 7.2.1 release.\nHaddock documentation can be found via <http://code.google.com/p/aern/wiki/Main>.";
