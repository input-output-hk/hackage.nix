It establishes a protocol\nfor sharing information on, and dealing in, swaps, derivatives,\nand structured products.  It is based on XML, the standard\nmeta-language for describing data shared between applications.\nAll categories of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives will\neventually be incorporated into the standard.\nThis package is an automatically-generated binding to version 5.3 of\nthe FpML standard.  The object-oriented typing discipline of the\noriginal XSD definition of FpML has been translated into Haskell's\nalgebraic types.  Type classes for parsing from, and outputting to,\nXML documents are instantiated for all types.";
