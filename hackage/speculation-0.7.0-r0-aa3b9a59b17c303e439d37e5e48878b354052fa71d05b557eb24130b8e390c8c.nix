      description = "A framework for safe, programmable, speculative parallelism, loosely based on:\n\n*  Prakash Prabhu, G. Ramalingam, and Kapil Vaswani, \\\"/Safe Programmable Speculative Parallelism/\\\",\nIn the proceedings of Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI) Vol 45, Issue 6 (June 2010) pp 50-61.\n<http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/118795/pldi026-vaswani.pdf>\n\nThis package provides speculative function application and speculative folds. Speculative STM transactions take the place\nof the transactional rollback machinery from the paper.\n\nFor example:\n\n@'spec' g f a@ evaluates @f g@ while forcing @a@, if @g == a@ then @f g@ is returned, otherwise @f a@ is evaluated and returned. Furthermore, if the argument has already been evaluated, we skip the @f g@ computation entirely. If a good guess at the value of @a@ is available, this is one way to induce parallelism in an otherwise sequential task. However, if the guess isn\\'t available more cheaply than the actual answer, then this saves no work and if the guess is wrong, you risk evaluating the function twice.\n\nThe best-case timeline looks like:\n\n> [---- f g ----]\n>    [----- a -----]\n> [-- spec g f a --]\n\nThe worst-case timeline looks like:\n\n> [---- f g ----]\n>    [----- a -----]\n>                  [---- f a ----]\n> [------- spec g f a -----------]\n\nCompare these to the timeline of @f $! a@:\n\n> [---- a -----]\n>              [---- f a ----]\n\n'specSTM' provides a similar time table for STM actions, but also rolls back side-effects.\n\n/Changes in 0.7.0:/\n\n* Changed @'throw' 'SpeculationException'@ to 'retry'\n* Removed 'SpeculationException'\n\n/Changes in 0.6.0:/\n\n* Upgraded the comparisons used by the STM combinators to STM actions, so they can check other STM state\n\n/Changes in 0.5.1:/\n\n* Exposed 'unsafeGetTagBits' and 'unsafeIsEvaluated'";
