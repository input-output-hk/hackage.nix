The main purpose\nof splitting this out is so that `primitive` can depend on\n`quickcheck-classes-base` in its test suite, avoiding the circular\ndependency that arises if `quickcheck-classes` is used instead.\n\nThis library provides QuickCheck properties to ensure\nthat typeclass instances adhere to the set of laws that\nthey are supposed to. There are other libraries that do\nsimilar things, such as `genvalidity-hspec` and `checkers`.\nThis library differs from other solutions by not introducing\nany new typeclasses that the user needs to learn.\n\n/Note:/ on GHC < 8.5, this library uses the higher-kinded typeclasses\n('Data.Functor.Classes.Show1', 'Data.Functor.Classes.Eq1', 'Data.Functor.Classes.Ord1', etc.),\nbut on GHC >= 8.5, it uses `-XQuantifiedConstraints` to express these\nconstraints more cleanly.";
