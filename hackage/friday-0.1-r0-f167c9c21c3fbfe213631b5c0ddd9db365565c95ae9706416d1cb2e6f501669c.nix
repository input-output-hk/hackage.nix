Except for I/Os, friday\nis entirely written in Haskell.\n\nImages can be represented in two representations:\n\n* the 'Manifest' representation stores images in Haskell\n'Vector's ;\n\n* the 'Delayed' representation uses functions to produce\nimages pixels. These images can be combined to produce\ncomplex transformations. By some inlining, Haskell\ncompilers are able to produce fast algorithms by\nremoving intermediate structures.\n\nThe library currently support four color spaces: RGB,\nRGBA, HSV and gray-scale images.\n\nPlease read our\n<https://github.com/RaphaelJ/friday/blob/master/README.md README>\nto get a detailed usage and some examples.";
