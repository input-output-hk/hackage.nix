      description = "/Reactive/ is a simple foundation for programming reactive systems\nfunctionally.  Like Fran\\/FRP, it has a notions of (reactive) behaviors and\nevents.  Like DataDriven, Reactive has a data-driven implementation.\nThe main difference between Reactive and DataDriven is that Reactive\nbuilds on functional \\\"futures\\\" (using threading), while DataDriven\nbuilds on continuation-based computations.\n\nPlease see the project wiki page: <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/reactive>\n\nThe module documentation pages have links to colorized source code and\nto wiki pages where you can read and contribute user comments.  Enjoy!\n\n&#169; 2007 by Conal Elliott; BSD3 license.";
