The location of the latest AWS Elastic Beanstalk WSDL is <http://elasticbeanstalk.s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2010-12-01/AWSElasticBeanstalk.wsdl>. To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that enable you to access the API, go to <https://aws.amazon.com/tools/ Tools for Amazon Web Services>.\n__Endpoints__\nFor a list of region-specific endpoints that AWS Elastic Beanstalk supports, go to <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticbeanstalk_region Regions and Endpoints> in the /Amazon Web Services Glossary/.\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.ElasticBeanstalk\" or <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ the AWS Documentation>\nto get started.";
