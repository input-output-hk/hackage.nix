It allows you to quickly write crawlers, and for simple cases ( like following links ) even without reading the page source.\n\nIt has useful features such as turning relative links from a page into absolute links, options to authorize transactions only on a given domain, and the option to only downloading html documents.\n\nIt also provides a nice syntax for filling out forms.\n\nAn example:\n\n> runShpider \$ do\n>      download \"http://apage.com\"\n>      theForm : _ <- getFormsByAction \"http://anotherpage.com\"\n>      sendForm \$ fillOutForm theForm \$ pairs \$ do\n>            \"occupation\" =: \"unemployed Haskell programmer\"\n>            \"location\" =: \"mother's house\"\n\nShpider contains a patched version of the curl package, to fix cookie handling.  The curl licence is therefore distributed with this package.";
