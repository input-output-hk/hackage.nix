      description = "This library provides a quasiquoter for executing shell commands, somewhat\nsimilar to Perl's backtick operator.  Shell commands are IO actions, and\nthey capture the command's standard output as a @String@ result.\n\nYou can use Haskell variables in a shell command.  A string representation\nof the contents will be interpolated.  The shell will see each interpolated\nvariable as a single token without interpreting special characters, unless\nyou choose otherwise.\n\nNote: The shell escaping is not correct for the Windows shell.  This library\nshould fail to build on Windows, as well.\n\nExamples of using this library are included in @examples/@.";
