The main differences\nbetween this library and the one described in the paper are that this library\ndoes not use the Typeable type class, and has a simpler API for handling\neffects.\n\nFor example, the following code implements a handler for exceptions:\n\n> runException :: Effect (Exception e ': es) a -> Effect es (Either e a)\n> runException =\n>     handle (\\x -> return (Right x))\n>     \$ eliminate (\\(Exception e) -> return (Left e))\n>     \$ defaultRelay\n\nCompare this to the corresponding code in extensible-effects:\n\n> runExc :: Typeable e => Eff (Exc e :> r) a -> Eff r (Either e a)\n> runExc = loop . admin\n>   where\n>     loop (Val x) = return (Right x)\n>     loop (E u)   = handleRelay u loop (\\(Exc e) -> return (Left e))\n\nIn particular:\n\n* Effect implementors are not required to do any recursion.\n\n* The functions for writing effect handlers can be easily composed.";
