      description = "AWS CloudFormation\nAWS CloudFormation enables you to create and manage AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. AWS CloudFormation helps you leverage AWS products such as Amazon EC2, EBS, Amazon SNS, ELB, and Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost effective applications without worrying about creating and configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure.\nWith AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources for you.\nFor more information about this product, go to the <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/ CloudFormation Product Page>.\nAmazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products. If you need additional technical information about a specific AWS product, you can find the product\\'s technical documentation at <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentation/>.\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.CloudFormation\" or <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ the AWS Documentation>\nto get started.";
