      description = "Amazon Simple Workflow Service\nThe Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build\napplications that use Amazon\\'s cloud to coordinate work across\ndistributed components. In Amazon SWF, a /task/ represents a logical\nunit of work that is performed by a component of your workflow.\nCoordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask\ndependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical\nflow of the application.\nAmazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and\ncoordinating them without worrying about underlying complexities such as\ntracking their progress and maintaining their state.\nThis documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of\nthe Amazon SWF programming model, see the\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/ Amazon SWF Developer Guide>.\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.SWF\" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/apireference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\nto get started.";
