Documentation: (<https://osa1.github.com/language-lua>)\n\nChangelog:\n\n\\0.4.5:\n\n- Fixed a bug that made lexer accept invalid escape sequences in strings.\n\n- Strings are now interpreted \\-\\- string \"\\\\n\" is now parsed to Haskell string \"\\\\n\", instead of \"\\\\\\\\n\".\n\n- Fixed character code parsing.\n\n\\0.4.4:\n\n- Printer now takes operator precedences into account while printing `Binop` and `Unop` expressions and prints parenthesis as necessary.\n\n- Printer now does not put line break in `Binop` expressions.\n\n\\0.4.3:\n\n- `Data` and `Typeable` instances are implemented for syntax tree.\n\n\\0.4.2:\n\n- More tweaks in pretty printer.\n\n- Started using 2 spaces for indentation(instead of 4 as before).\n\n\\0.4.1:\n\n- Some tweaks in pretty-printer.\n\n\\0.4.0:\n\n- `Table` and `FunDef` nodes are removed from simplified syntax.\n\n\\0.3.1:\n\n- Fixed incorrectly exported name `exp` in `Language.Lua.Parser` module.\n\n\\0.3.0:\n\n- Added non-annotated syntax to make code-generation easier.\n\n\\0.2.3:\n\n- Minor internal changes.\n\n\\0.2.2:\n\n- Some tweaks in pretty-printer.\n\n\\0.2.0:\n\n- Syntax tree is annotated. All parsers(`parseText`, `parseFile`) annotate resulting tree with source positions.";
