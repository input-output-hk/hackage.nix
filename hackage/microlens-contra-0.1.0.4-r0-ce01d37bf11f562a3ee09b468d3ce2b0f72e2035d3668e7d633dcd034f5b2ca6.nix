Most functions from lens that work with @Fold@ would work with @SimpleFold@ as well, though.\n\nStarting from GHC 8.6, this package doesn't depend on contravariant anymore.\n\nThis package is a part of the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens microlens> family; see the readme <https://github.com/stevenfontanella/microlens#readme on Github>.";
