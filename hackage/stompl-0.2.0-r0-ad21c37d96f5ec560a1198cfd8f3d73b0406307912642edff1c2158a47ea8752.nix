      description = "The Stomp Protocol specifies message-oriented interoperability.\nApplications connect to a message broker to send (publish)\nor receive (subscribe) messages through queues.\nInteroperating applications do not know\nthe location or internal structure of each other.\nThey see only each other's interfaces, /i.e./ the messages\npublished and subscribed through the broker.\nBroker and application use a protocol based on the\nexchange of commands and other data packets, called /frames/.\nThe Stompl library provides abstractions over Stomp frames\nand a Stomp frame parser.\nIt does not implement a client or broker itself,\nbut provides abstractions to libraries and programs doing so.\nIt is used by the Stompl Queue library (stomp-queues).\nMore documentation and a test suite can be found on\n<https://github.com/toschoo/mom/>.\nThe Stomp specification can be found at\n<http://stomp.github.com>.\n\nRelease History:\n\n[0.2.0] The mime package (Codec.MIME) switch from String\nto Text in 0.4. We follow. Thanks, Dave!\n\n[0.1.1] Dependency for bytestring set to 0.10\n\n[0.1.0] Major changes:\n\n- Compliance with Stomp 1.2:\n\n- header keys and values are now escaped;\nthis, in fact, was missing for Stomp 1.1.\n\n- header keys and values are not trimmed or padded;\nthis, as well, should have been done for Stomp 1.1 already.\nBe aware that Stomp 1.0-like message headers\nmay fail now, /e.g./:\n/message : hello world/\nis not the same anymore as\n/message:hello world/\n\n- carriage return (ascii 13) plus line feed (ascii 10)\nis now accepted as end-of-line;\nnote that stompl never generates carriage return as end-of-line,\nthe standard end-of-line remains line feed.\n\n- the Message frame may have an /ack/ header\nand should have when a message is sent\nthrough a queue that requires explicit ack.\n\n- the mandatory header in the Ack frame is now /id/\ninstead of /message-id/. It should correspond to /ack/\nin the message that is ack'd.\nNote that, to ease backward compatibility,\nAck frames are generated with both:\nan /id/ and a /message-id/ header.\n\n- a Stomp frame was added.\nThe Stomp frame has exactly the same format\nas the Connect frame, but it is handled differently\nwith respect to escaping: Connect header keys and values\nare not escaped, Stomp header keys and values, however, are.\n\n[0.0.3] Major changes:\n\n- new attribute \"ClientId\" in Connect frame\nfor compatibility with ActiveMQ;\n\n- all commands accept additional headers\nto ease adaptations to broker-specific features.\n\n[0.0.2] Minor corrections and documentation\n\n[0.0.1] Initial Release";
