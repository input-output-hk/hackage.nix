I made this library\nbecause I was dissatisfied with the @Monad@ instance for @Either@. In this\ntype, @fail = Failure@. It's rather simple.\n\nChanges\n\n[0.1.5.0] Add @exceptIO@ function to encapsulate IO errors in the\n@Exceptional@ monad.\n\n[0.1.4.3] Fix bug where @exceptional@ won't compile on @base < 4.8@.\nAlso move the changelog back to the description so it's more\nvisible.\n\n[0.1.4.2] Moved change log to a separate file so Hackage displays\nit correctly.\n\n[0.1.4.1] Documentation enhancements/fixes.\n\n[0.1.4.0] Added @fromMaybe@ and @toMaybe@ functions, and a link to\nthe bug tracker.\n\n[0.1.3.0] Fixed a typo. 0.1.2.0 won't build. Also added definition\nof @empty@ for @Alternative@.\n\n[0.1.2.0] Added @fromEither@ and @toEither@ functions.\n\n[0.1.1.3] Hackage is terrible. Yet another formatting fix.\n\n[0.1.1.2] Yet another formatting fix.\n\n[0.1.1.1] Formatting fix to the haddock documentation.\n\n[0.1.1.0] Add @runExceptional@ function.\n\n[0.1.0.1] Minor documentation changes. No changes to the API.\n\n[0.1.0.0] Initial version";
