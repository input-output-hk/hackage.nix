The Uniplate manual is available at\n<http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/darcs/uniplate/uniplate.htm>.\n\nTo get started with Uniplate you should import one of the three following\nmodules:\n\n* \"Data.Generics.Uniplate.Data\" - to quickly start writing generic functions.\nMost users should start by importing this module.\n\n* \"Data.Generics.Uniplate.Direct\" - a replacement for \"Data.Generics.Uniplate.Data\"\nwith substantially higher performance (around 5 times), but requires writing\ninstance declarations.\n\n* \"Data.Generics.Uniplate.Operations\" - definitions of all the operations defined\nby Uniplate. Both the above two modules re-export this module.\n\nIn addition, some users may want to make use of the following modules:\n\n* \"Data.Generics.Uniplate.Zipper\" - a zipper built on top of Uniplate instances.\n\n* \"Data.Generics.SYB\" - users transitioning from the Scrap Your Boilerplate library.\n\n* \"Data.Generics.Compos\" - users transitioning from the Compos library.\n\n* \"Data.Generics.Uniplate.DataOnly\" - users making use of both @Data@ and @Direct@\nto avoid getting instance conflicts.";
