At any time windows are\narranged so as to maximise the use of screen real estate. All\nfeatures of the window manager are accessible purely from the\nkeyboard: a mouse is entirely optional.  Xmonad is configured in\nHaskell, and custom layout algorithms may be implemented by the user\nin config files. A principle of Xmonad is predictability: the user\nshould know in advance precisely the window arrangement that will\nresult from any action.";
