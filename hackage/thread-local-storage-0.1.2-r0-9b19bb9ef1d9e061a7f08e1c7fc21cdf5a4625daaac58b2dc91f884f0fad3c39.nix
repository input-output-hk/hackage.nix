This package provides a few\ndifferent implementations of a simple TLS API.\n\nAll exported public modules provide exactly the same interface with\ndifferent implementations.  Run the included criterion benchmark\nsuite to ascertain which performs the best on your platform.\n\nExample criterion benchmark data can be found here (from an Intel Ivy-Bridge i7-3770 desktop):\n<http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~rrnewton/datasets/xmen_tls_report.html>";
