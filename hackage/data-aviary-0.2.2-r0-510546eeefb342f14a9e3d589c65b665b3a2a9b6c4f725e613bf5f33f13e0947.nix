This\nmight be usefulfor /bird-watching/ i.e. spotting instances\nwhere an Applicative, Monad or whatever operation corresponds\nto a combinator bird. Again this module is not intended for\nactual use.\n\nPlus a smaller set (Data.Aviary) intended to be useful,\ncollecting combinators that have already /escaped/ (published\nelsewhere) but aren\\'t in Data.Function, along with some\npersonal favourites.\n\nChangelog:\n\n0.2.2 added Data.Aviary.Functional - Applicative, Monad etc.\nsignatures specialized to the function type.\n\n0.2.1 added @dup@ and the /combiner/ variants of cardinal-prime.\n\n0.2.0 added Haddock docs for @(\\#\\#)@.";
