      description = "Changes from 0.8 to 0.9\n\n* Removed 'identity' from the Interned class, to support applications where the identity is obtained by other means (e.g. a unique Ptr value)\n\nChanges from 0.7 to 0.8\n\n* Disabled cache removal as it was causing problems on large data sets. There is no good way to ensure that both references remain alive long enough to finish comparisons.\n* Switched to IORef from MVar\n\nChanges from 0.6 to 0.7\n\n* Fixed problem where comparisons could happen between data structures while one was still a thunk, leading to equal structures comparing as inequal in limited circumstances, by appropriately using strictness annotations.\n\nEfficient hash-consing for arbitrary data types\n\nChanges from 0.5.2 to 0.6\n\n* Widened the caches so they don't go through a single MVar per type. This has made a dramatic impact on performance. However, this broke the previous invariant that newer entries always had higher Ids than older entries.\n\nChanges from 0.5.1 to 0.5.2\n\n* Added Data.Interned.IntSet";
