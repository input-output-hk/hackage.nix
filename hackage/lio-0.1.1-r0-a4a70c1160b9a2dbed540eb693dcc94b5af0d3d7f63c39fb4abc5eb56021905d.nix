Most code should import module \"LIO\" and\nwhichever label type the application is using (e.g.,\n\"LIO.DCLabel\").  The core functionality of the library is\ndocumented in \"LIO.TCB\".  LIO was implemented by David\nMazieres (<http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/>), Deian Stefan\n(<http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~deian/>), Alejandro Russo\n(<http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/>) and John C. Mitchell\n(<http://www.stanford.edu/~jcm/>).\nThe extended version of our paper, that includes the proofs\nis available here:\n<http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~deian/pubs/stefan:2011:flexible-ext.pdf>.\nThe library depends on the @DCLabel@ module.
