      description = "The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is an iterative\ntechnique that finds a local minimum of a function that\nis expressed as the sum of squares of nonlinear\nfunctions. It has become a standard technique for\nnonlinear least-squares problems and can be thought of\nas a combination of steepest descent and the\nGauss-Newton method. When the current solution is far\nfrom the correct one, the algorithm behaves like a\nsteepest descent method: slow, but guaranteed to\nconverge. When the current solution is close to the\ncorrect solution, it becomes a Gauss-Newton method.\n\nOptional box- and linear constraints can be given. Both\nsingle and double precision floating point types are\nsupported.\n\nThe actual algorithm is implemented in a C library\nwhich is bundled with bindings-levmar which this\npackage depends on. See:\n<http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/>.\n\nThis library consists of two layers:\n\n* LevMar.Intermediate: A medium-level layer that wraps\nthe low-level functions from bindings-levmar to\nprovide a more Haskell friendly interface.\n\n* LevMar: A high-level layer that uses type-level\nprogramming to add extra type safety.\n\nEach layer also has special curve-fitting variants:\n\n* LevMar.Intermediate.Fitting\n\n* LevMar.Fitting\n\nEach layer also has special variants that automatically compute\nthe jacobian using automatic differentiation using Conal\nElliott's vector-space library:\n\n* LevMar.Intermediate.AD\n\n* LevMar.Intermediate.Fitting.AD\n\n* LevMar.AD\n\n* LevMar.Fitting.AD\n\nNote however that this feature is still very experimental!\n\nAll modules are self-contained; i.e. each module\nre-exports all the things you need to work with it.\n\nFor an example how to use this library see Demo.hs\nwhich is included in this package. Demo.hs is a Haskell\ntranslation of lmdemo.c from the C levmar library.\n\nA note regarding the license:\n\nThis library depends on bindings-levmar which is\nbundled together with a C library which falls under the\nGPL. Please be aware of this when distributing programs\nlinked with this library. For details see the\ndescription and license of bindings-levmar.";
