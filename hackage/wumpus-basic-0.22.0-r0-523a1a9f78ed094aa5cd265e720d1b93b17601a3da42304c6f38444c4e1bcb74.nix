This\npackage provides font loader code (currently limited to AFM font\nfiles) and a various /drawing objects/ intended to be a\nhigher-level basis to make vector drawings than the primitives\n(paths, text labels) provided by Wumpus-Core.\n\n\\*\\* WARNING \\*\\* - this package is alpha grade and it is\nstrongly coupled to the package @Wumpus-Drawing@ which is\nsub-alpha grade. The packages are split as it is expected they\nwill have different development speeds - @Wumpus-Basic@ needs\npolishing and refinement; @Wumpus-Drawing@ simply needs a lot of\nwork to move its components from /proof-of-concept/ ideas to\nbeing readily usable.\n\n\nNOTE - the demos that were previously included are now in the\npackage @Wumpus-Drawing@.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\nv0.21.0 to v0.22.0:\n\n* Reverted argument order of @run@ functions they back to the\n@monadLib@ style (args * monadic_operation) rather than @MTL@\nstyle (monadic_operation * args). Typographically this seems\nbetter.\n\n* Removed module @Geometry.Paths@ it is superseded in\nWumpus-Drawing.\n\n* Added user state to PosObject and moved it into\n@Kernel.Drawing@.\n\n* Changed the enumeration @DrawStyle@ to @DrawMode@. Added\nanother enumeration @PathMode@.\n\n* Changed Chain so that first item in the chain is the start\npoint (previously the start point was iterated by the chain).\n\n* Removed @ConnectorProps@ from the @DrawingContext@ , they are\nnow used \\\"locally\\\" in Wumpus-Drawing.\n\n* Added more vector constructors to\n@Kernel.Objects.Displacement@.\n\n* Added extra methods to the @Decorate@ class for annotating\nSVG elements.\n\nv0.20.0 to v0.21.0:\n\n* The code from the @Kernel.Base.UserState@ module has been\nmoved to the module @Kernel.Drawing.Basis@.\n\n* Moved @Image@ and @Query@ from @Objects.Basis@ to new module\n@Objects.Image@. Moved @Chain@, @CtxPicture@ and\n@TraceDrawing@ into the new @Drawing@ folder.\n\n* Added @Wumpus.Basic.Kernel.Drawing.LocDrawing@ module.\n\n* Rationalized the combinators exported by the drawing objects\n@Image@, @LocImage@, @LocThetaImage@ and @Connector@.\n\n";
