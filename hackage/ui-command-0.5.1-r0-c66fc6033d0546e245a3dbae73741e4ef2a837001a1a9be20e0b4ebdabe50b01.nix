It implements default ''help''\nand ''man'' commands for your application, which will layout help\ntext and generate Unix-style man pages.\n\nIt provides special handling for applications of the form\n''program command args'', the style of interaction common in revision\ncontrol systems. It will dispatch to handler functions that you\nprovide for each command, and also provide command-specific\nhelp to the user.";
