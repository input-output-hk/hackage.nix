      description = "This package contains a universal CI/build script @packcheck.sh@ and config\nfiles designed such that you can just copy over\n@.github\\/workflows/packcheck.yml@, @appveyor.yml@, @.circleci/config.yml@\nor @.cirrus.yml@ to your package repo and your package is CI ready\nin a jiffy.  You can build and test packages on local machine as\nwell. For local testing, copy @packcheck.sh@ to your local machine,\nput it in your PATH, and run it from your package directory:\n\n> $ packcheck.sh cabal\n> $ packcheck.sh stack\n\nYou can try the script on this package itself. It builds and comprehensively\nsanity tests a Haskell package across build tools (stack/cabal), uniformly,\nconsistently and across all platforms (Linux\\/MacOS\\/Windows).  You do not\nneed to be familiar with any of the build tools to use it.\n\nThis is also a minimal yet complete model package (with tests, benchmarks, CI\nalready working) that can be used as a starting point to develop a new\npackage. Beginners can use it to learn about haskell package metadata\nstructure, benchmarks, tests, CI configs etc.\n\nSee the README for comprehensive documentation.";
