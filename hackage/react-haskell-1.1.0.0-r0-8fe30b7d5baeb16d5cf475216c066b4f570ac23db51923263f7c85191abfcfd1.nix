React (and React-Haskell) is focused on just UI - it's not a framework.\n\nCurrently React-Haskell can render simple stateful components, but not what React calls classes. Put another way, React-Haskell doesn't support lifecycle methods yet.\n\nHere's a simple example which demonstrates basic elements, attributes, state, and handling events.\n\n> statefulView :: StatefulReact JSString ()\n> statefulView = div_ <! class_ \"container\" \$ do\n>     str <- getState\n>     input_ <! value_ str\n>            <! onChange (\\_ evt -> toJSStr \$ map toUpper \$ fromJSStr \$ targetValue evt)";
