QML code can access these\nsignals and slots on the 'app' context object.  Haskell code can emit\nsignals by using the 'emit' function exported from the generated\nHaskadesBinding.  The 'emit' call is threadsafe.\n\nText, Lazy Text, and String all end up as QString so that QML can\nwork with them properly, and vice-versa.  UTCTime becomes QDateTime.\nInt, Double, and () are passed through fairly directly.  Other types\nmay have support added as there is need.";
