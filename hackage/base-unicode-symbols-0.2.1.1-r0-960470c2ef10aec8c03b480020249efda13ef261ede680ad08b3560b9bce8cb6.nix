This extension enables Unicode characters\nto be used to stand for certain ASCII character sequences. For GHC\n6.12.3 it provides the following alternatives:\n\n* &#x2237; (U+2237, PROPORTION) instead of @::@\n\n* &#x21D2; (U+21D2, RIGHTWARDS DOUBLE ARROW) instead of @=>@\n\n* &#x2200; (U+2200, FOR ALL) instead of @forall@\n\n* &#x2192; (U+2192, RIGHTWARDS ARROW) instead of @->@\n\n* &#x2190; (U+2190, LEFTWARDS ARROW) instead of @<-@\n\nOriginal idea by P&#xE9;ter Divi&#xE1;nszky.\n\n\\[1\\] <http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/syntax-extns.html#unicode-syntax>";
