      description = "A parser for Open Financial Exchange (OFX) financial data. This\nhandles OFX version 1.03, which is documented at http://www.ofx.net\nThis also handles QFX, which is OFX plus some minor additions made\nby Intuit, the publishers of Quicken.\n\nThe parser will place all the data into a tree, which you can query\nfor whatever data you may need, although you will need to be\nfamiliar with the OFX spec to do this. There is also a Transaction\ntype which you can easily parse from the tree; this will contain\nmost, if not all, of the data you will be interested in if your OFX\nfile is from a bank or credit card account.\n\nAll the OFX and QFX files I have seen use the format from the 1.0\nseries of OFX, which is primarily SGML based. OFX version 2 is XML\nbased. If this parser works on those files, consider it a happy\naccident.\n\nThe OFX spec is available at <http://www.ofx.net>";
