Full access to the .NET object model is provided,\nletting you create and manipulate .NET objects.\n\nSupport for calling back into to Haskell from .NET code is also supported,\nexposing Haskell code as delegates.\n\nWork on broadening the interop even further between the two worlds is underway.\n\nMore info on package and its features at <http://haskell.forkIO.com/dotnet>";
