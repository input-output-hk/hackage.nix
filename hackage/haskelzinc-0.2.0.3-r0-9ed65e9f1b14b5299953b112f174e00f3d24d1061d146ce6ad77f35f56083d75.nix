It provides a Haskell abstract syntax tree for the MiniZinc language, with which one can represent MiniZinc models in Haskell, a pretty printer to print the representation of a MiniZinc model in MiniZinc and a parser that returns a representation of the solutions obtained by running the MiniZinc model.\n\nAn additional module gives the possibility to directly get the solutions of a MiniZinc finite domain model. Option for interactive interface is provided, as well as choice between two solvers: the G12/FD built-in solver of FlatZinc and choco3.";
