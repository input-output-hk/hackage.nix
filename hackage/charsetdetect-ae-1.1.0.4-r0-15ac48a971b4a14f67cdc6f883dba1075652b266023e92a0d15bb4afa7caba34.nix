The algorithm is able to detect all of the most frequently encountered character encodings totally automatically.\n\nThis library wraps up their library and exposes a very simple Haskell interface to it. The library is portable, and is confirmed to work on both Unix and Windows.\n\nThis library is a /maintained/ fork of charsetdetect:\n\n* It compiles with recent version of bytestring.\n\n* It works correctly in presence of Template Haskell on GHC 7.6.\n\n* It builds on 64-bit Windows.";
