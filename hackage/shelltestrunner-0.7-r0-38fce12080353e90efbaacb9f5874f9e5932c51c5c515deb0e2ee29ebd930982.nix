      description = "\nRun a command-line program through \\\"shell tests\\\" defined in one or\nmore test files. Each test specifies command-line arguments, some input,\nand expected output, stderr output and/or exit status.\nWe use test-framework's test runner, so can run tests in parallel.\nshelltestrunner was inspired by the tests in John Wiegley's ledger project.\n\nUsage:\n\n> shelltestrunner [FLAGS] EXECUTABLE [TESTFILES ...]\n>\n>   -? --help[=FORMAT]           Show usage information (optional format)\n>   -V --version                 Show version information\n>   -v --verbose                 Higher verbosity\n>   -q --quiet                   Lower verbosity\n>   -d --debug                   show debug messages\n>      --debug-parse             show parsing debug messages and stop\n>   -i --implicit=none|exit|all  provide implicit tests (default=exit)\n\nAny unrecognised options will be passed through to test-framework's runner.\nYou may be able to get a big speedup by running tests in parallel: try -j16.\n\nA test file contains one or more shell tests, each of which looks like this:\n\n> # optional comment lines beginning with #\n> -opt1 -opt2 arg1 arg2 # one line of command line args, executable will be prepended\n> <<<\n> 0 or more lines of input\n> >>> [/regexp/] [optional comment beginning with #]\n> [..or 0 or more lines of expected output]\n> >>>2 [/regexp/] [optional comment]\n> [..or 0 or more lines of expected error output]\n> >>>= [expected exit status or /regexp/] [optional comment]\n> # optional comment lines\n\nThe expected output and expected error output fields can have either a\nregular expression match expression, in which case the test passes if the\noutput is matched, or 0 or more following data lines, in which case the\noutput must match these exactly. The expected exit status field can have\neither a numeric exit code or a regular expression match expression. A !\npreceding a an exit code or \\/regexp\\/ negates the match. The regular\nexpression syntax is that of the pcre-light library with the dotall flag.\n\nThe command line args field is required, all others are optional.  By\ndefault there is an implicit test for exit status = 0, but no implicit\ntest for stdout or stderr.  You can change this with the\n-i/--implicit-tests flag.\n\nSome issues to be aware of:\n\n- uncompiled haskell scripts can't be tested due to http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/3890\n\n- unparseable test files and uncompilable regexps are counted as test failures\n";
