In our student research project,\nShivers' algorithms and proofs are formalized using the theorem prover\nsystem Isabelle.\n\nThis package contains the Haskell prototype of the Isabelle\nformalization, together with some pretty printing and rendering\nfacilities. It is provided as a reference, not as a ready-to-use library.";
