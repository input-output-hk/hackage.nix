You're highly\ninvited to contribute ;).\n__EAX__ is not supported yet eiher. It'll be embedded in\nfuture releases, soon.\n__IMPORTANT__: In order to build and install \"al\", you'll\nneed to pass the path of the /include/ and /libs/ directory\nof your OpenAL installation.\nThen use this to install:\n@ cabal install --extra-include-dirs=path_to_include --extr-lib-dirs=path_to_libs @";
