      synopsis = "an elementary streaming prelude and a general stream type.";
      description = "@Streaming.Prelude@ exports an elementary streaming prelude relating to\nan elementary source\\/generator\\/producer type, namely @Stream (Of a) m r@.\nThe main module, @Streaming@, exports a much more general type,\n@Stream f m r@, which\ncan be used to stream successive distinct steps characterized by /any/\nfunctor @f@, though we are here interested only in a limited range of\ncases.\n\nThe streaming-io libraries have various devices for dealing\nwith effectful variants of @[a]@ or @([a],r)@. But it is only with\nthe general type @Stream f m r@, or some equivalent,\nthat one can hope to stream their sorts of stream, as one\nmakes lists of lists in the Haskell @Prelude@ and @Data.List@.\nOne needs some such type if we are to\nexpress a properly streaming equivalent of e.g.\n\n> group :: Ord a => [a] -> [[a]]\n> chunksOf :: Int -> [a] -> [[a]]\n> lines :: [Char] -> [[Char]] -- but similarly with bytestring, etc.\n\nto mention a few obviously desirable operations. But once one grasps\nthe concept needed to express those functions - i.e. @Stream f m r@ or\nsome equivalent - then one will also see that,\nwith it, one is already in possession of a complete\nelementary streaming library - since one possesses @Stream (Of a) m r@, which\nis the type of a \\'generator\\' or \\'producer\\' or whatever you call an\neffectful stream of items. The present @Streaming.Prelude@ is the\nsimplest streaming library that can replicate anything like the\nAPI of the @Prelude@ and @Data.List@.\n\nThe emphasis of the library is on interoperation; for\nthe rest its advantages are: extreme simplicity and re-use of\nintuitions the user has gathered from mastery of @Prelude@ and\n@Data.List@. The two conceptual pre-requisites are some\ncomprehension of monad transformers and some familiarity\nwith \\'rank 2 types\\'.\n\nSee the\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming#readme readme> below\nfor an explanation, including the examples linked there. Elementary usage can be divined from the ghci examples in\n@Streaming.Prelude@ and perhaps from this rough beginning of a\n<https://github.com/michaelt/streaming-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial.md tutorial> Note also the\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-bytestring streaming bytestring>\nand\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-utils streaming utils>\npackages.\n\nThe simplest form of interoperation with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes pipes>\nis accomplished with this isomorphism:\n\n> Pipes.unfoldr Streaming.next        :: Stream (Of a) m r   -> Producer a m r\n> Streaming.unfoldr Pipes.next        :: Producer a m r      -> Stream (Of a) m r\n\nInteroperation with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams io-streams> is thus:\n\n> Streaming.reread IOStreams.read     :: InputStream a       -> Stream (Of a) IO ()\n> IOStreams.unfoldM Streaming.uncons  :: Stream (Of a) IO () -> IO (InputStream a)\n\nA simple exit to <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit conduit> would be, e.g.:\n\n> Conduit.unfoldM Streaming.uncons    :: Stream (Of a) m ()  -> Source m a\n\nThese conversions should never be more expensive than a single @>->@ or @=\$=@. Further\npoints of comparison are discussed in the\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming#readme readme>\nbelow.\n\nHere are the results of some\n<https://gist.github.com/michaelt/f19bef01423b17f29ffd microbenchmarks>\nbased on the\n<https://github.com/ekmett/machines/blob/master/benchmarks/Benchmarks.hs benchmarks>\nincluded in the machines package:\n\n<<http://i.imgur.com/sSG5MvH.png>>\n";
