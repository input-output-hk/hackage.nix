A genetic algorithm is an evolutionary technique,\ninspired by biological evolution, to evolve entities that perform\nas good as possible in terms of a predefined criterion (the scoring\nfunction). Note: lower scores are assumed to indicate better entities.\nThe GA module provides a type class for defining entities and the\nfunctions that are required by the genetic algorithm.\nCheckpointing in between generations is available, as is automatic\nrestoring from the last available checkpoint.";
