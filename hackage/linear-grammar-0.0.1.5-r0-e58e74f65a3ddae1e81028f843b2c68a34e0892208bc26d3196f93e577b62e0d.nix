As an example:\n\n> 12x + 3y - 4z + 12 <= 43x - 7b + 8q\n\nWould look like...\n\n> f = (12 :: Double) .*. EVar \"x\" .+.\n>     (3 :: Double) .*. EVar \"y\" .+.\n>     (-4 :: Double) .*. EVar \"z\" .+.\n>     ELit 12\n>     .<=.\n>     (43 :: Double) .*. EVar \"x\" .+.\n>     (-7 :: Double) .*. EVar \"b\" .+.\n>     (8 :: Double) .*. EVar \"q\"\n\nI've added some overloading functionality, to help ease the verbosity of the\nabove statements - an @IsString@ instance, and some other utilities. To pack\nthe equation into <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation#General_.28or_standard.29_form standard form>,\nuse the @sandardForm@ function:\n\n> stdF = standardForm f";
