      description = "Run a given program through \"shell\" tests specifed by\none or more test files, each of which specifies:\ncommand-line arguments, input, expected output,\nexpected stderr output, and expected exit code.  This\nwas extracted from the hledger project, and inspired\nby the tests in John Wiegley's ledger project.\nThis uses test-framework's test runner. Any command-line\noptions are passed through to the test-framework runner,\nbut they must not contain spaces, so use eg -tpattern not\n-t pattern. You may be able to get a big speedup by\nrunning tests in parallel: try -j8.\nUsage:\n\$ shelltestrunner [testrunneropts] executable testfile1 [testfile2 ...]\nTest file format:\n; 0 or more comment lines beginning with ;\n-opt1 -opt2 arg1 arg2\n<<<\n0 or more lines of input\n>>>\n0 or more lines of expected output\n>>>2\n0 or more lines of expected error output\n>>>=\nexpected numeric exit code\nInitial lines beginning with ; are ignored.  The next line\nis the command-line arguments which will be appended to\nthe executable name.  All remaining fields are optional;\nwhen omitted they are assumed to be \"\", \"\", \"\", and 0\nrespectively.\nIssues:\n- on mac, will hang if executable does not read stdin\n- output order is mixed up\n- can't test input/ouput which does not end with newline";
