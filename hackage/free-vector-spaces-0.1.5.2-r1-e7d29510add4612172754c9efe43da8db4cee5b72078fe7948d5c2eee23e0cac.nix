      description = "The <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear/ linear> package offers efficient\nvector types — where vector means /element of a free vector space/, i.e.\nfixed-length arrays of numbers. The entire interface of that library is based on\nthis  concept of free vectors with a canonical coordinate representation.\n\nWhile this is practically speaking often useful, it is also\n\n* Questionable in terms of conceptual elegance. The idea of a vector has\noriginally not much to do with number-arrays; in physics a vector is just\na quantity with /magnitude and direction/. Only by fixing a basis can\na coordinate representation arise from that.\n\n* Not as safe as we'd like. The typical linear-algebra languages like Matlab\nor Fortran are notorious for hard-to spot mistakes that often arise from the\ntotal reliance on coordinate representations (every vector/linear map is just\na matrix of number). @linear@ already avoids most of these problems because\nit can at least check dimensions at compile-time and usually doesn't need\nany indices, but some trouble still remains. E.g., two different 3-dimensional\nspaces are indistinguishable by the type system (unless you wrap one of them\nin a @newtype@, however that also needs to be parameterised on the coordinate\ntype to work with the rest of the library).\n\nThe <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-space/ vector-space> library\nhas arguably a better (albeit less complete) interface. To gain access to\nthat interface with the more efficient types from @linear@, we here provide\nthe necessary orphan instances.";
