      description = "Haskell has, and makes great use of, powerful facilities from category\ntheory – basically various variants of functors.\n\nHowever, all those are just endofunctors in Hask, the category of\nall Haskell types with functions as morphisms. Which is sufficient\nfor container / control structures that you want to be able to handle\nany type of data, but otherwise it's a bit limiting, seeing as\nthere are (in maths, science etc.) many categories that cannot properly\nbe represented this way. Commonly used libraries such as\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-space> thus make\nlittle notion of the fact that the objects they deal with actually\nform a category, instead defining just specialised versions of\nthe operations.\n\nThis library generalises functors etc. to a much wider class of\ncategories, by allowing for constraints on objects (so these can have\nextra properties required). At the same time, we try to keep as close\nas possible to the well-known Haskell type class hierarchies rather\nthan exactly adopting the mathematicians' notions.\n\nConsider the README file, the examples, and/or the documentation to\n\"Control.Category.Constrained\" for how to make use of this.";
