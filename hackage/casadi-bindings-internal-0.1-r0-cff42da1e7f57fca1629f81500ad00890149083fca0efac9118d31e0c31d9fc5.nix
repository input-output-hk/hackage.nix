(Get the version corresponding to the current casadi-bindings version, for example casadi-bindings-1.9.0.0 is libcasadi 1.9.0)\n\nThen,\n- `cabal update; cabal install casadi-bindings`\n\nTemporary note: there is something wrong with casadi and ipopt related to http://list.coin-or.org/pipermail/ipopt/2014-April/003670.html, and https://github.com/casadi/casadi/issues/1075. At the moment this .cabal package works for me as is, but YMMV";
