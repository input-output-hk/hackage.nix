Beware that poking the internal I2C buses of your PC or laptop may cause hardware damage. I test and use this library with an external i2c_tiny_usb adapter. (Note that the i2c_tiny_usb kernel driver is broken in 4.9 and 4.11. But it works with this patch: https:\\/\\/patchwork.kernel.org\\/patch\\/9711919\\/)";
