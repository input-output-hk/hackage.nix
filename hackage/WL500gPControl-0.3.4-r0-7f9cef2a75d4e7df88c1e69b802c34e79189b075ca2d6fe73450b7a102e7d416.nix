It has simple format:\n\n@\nuser: \\<user name\\>\npassword: \\<password\\>\nhost: \\<host name or IP address\\>\n@\n\nThe password should be in plain text, so it is recommended to protect this\nfile from reading for everyone except you.\n\nIf credentials file is not given, than programs will try to use default\ncredential file, which should be located:\n\n* on Linux: @\$HOME\\/.WL500gPControl\\/credentials@\n\n* on Windows: @C\\:\\\\Documents And Settings\\\\user\\\\Application Data\\\\WL500gPControl\\\\credentials@\n\nSometimes paths could be different. To determine the read path to the\ndefault credentials file run @WL500gPControl -s@ and look at the error string, where\nwill be sayed where it searches credentials file.";
