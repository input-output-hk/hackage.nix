They consume fresh values from user-supplied comonads.\nCurrently, two approaches are implemented:\n\n* In @Stream@, the comonad provides a way to succeed a value.\n\n* In @Delta@, the comonad provides a way to split the value or to succeeded\nit. The benefit is that the underlying functor doesn't need to be a monad.";
