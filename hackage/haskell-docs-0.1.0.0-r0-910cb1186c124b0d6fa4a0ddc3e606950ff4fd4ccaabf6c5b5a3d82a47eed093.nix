I suggest\ninstalling like this:\n\n> cabal-dev install haskell-docs --constraint haddock==2.10.0\n\nBut replace the 2.10.0 with the version that haddock --version gives you.\n\nI could perhaps instead have a flag for each GHC\nrelease back a few versions.\n\n/USING WITH GHCI/\n\n> > :def doc \\input -> return (\":!haskell-docs \" ++ input)\n> > :doc System.IO getContents base\n> The getContents operation returns all user input as a single string,\n>  which is read lazily as it is needed\n>  (same as hGetContents stdin).\n\nAdd the above :def to your user .ghci to have it on start-up.\n\n/CONTRIBUTION AND ISSUES/\n\nIssues/ideas/contributions please make a Github issue: <http://github.com/chrisdone/haskell-docs/issues>\n";
