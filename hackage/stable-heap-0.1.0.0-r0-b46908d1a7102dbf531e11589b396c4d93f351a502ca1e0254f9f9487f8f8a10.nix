      description = "This library provides a purely functional implementation of\nstable heaps (fair priority queues). The data structure is a\ncousin of the pairing heap which maintains a sequential\nordering of the keys. Insertion can be to either end of the\nheap, as though it is a deque, and it can be split on the\nleft-most occurrence of the minimum key.\n\nThe current state of the package is fairly barebones. It will\nbe fleshed out later.";
