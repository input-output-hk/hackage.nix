In particular, it is unable to fully apply any function returning an\nunboxed tuple, create a function that takes a non-nullary unboxed tuple as\nargument, or pass a non-nullary tuple to some other function. The usual\nsolution is to enable object code generation with @-fobject-code@. This\npackage serves as a workaround for the cases where @-fobject-code@ is\nundesiable.";
