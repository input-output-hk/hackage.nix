The @http-io-streams@ API designed for ease of use when querying web services and dealing with the result as streaming I/O.\n\nThe library is exported in a single module; see \"Network.Http.Client\"\nfor full documentation.\n\n__NOTE__: This is a fork of [http-streams](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-streams)\nwith a lighter dependency footprint which focuses on core HTTP\nfunctionality and as a consequence doesn't include out-of-the-box\nsupport for handling JSON data. If you need support for handling JSON\nweb-services, you should use the original @http-streams@ package instead of\nthis package.";
