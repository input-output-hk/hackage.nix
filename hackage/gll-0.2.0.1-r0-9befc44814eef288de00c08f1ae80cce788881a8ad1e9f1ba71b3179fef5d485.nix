      description = "GLL is a parser combinator library for writing generalised parsers.\nThe parsers can correspond to arbitrary context-free grammar, accepting\nboth non-determinism and (left-) recursion.\nThe underlying parsing algorithm is GLL (Scott and Johnstone 2013)\nThe library provides an interface in Control.Applicative style (although no\ninstance of Applicative is given).\nUsers can add arbitrary semantic with the <\$> combinator.\nThere are 4 top-level functions: parse, parseString, parseWithOptions\nand parseStringWithOptions. They all return a list of semantic results,\none for each derivation. In the case that infinite derivations are possible\nonly 'good parse trees' are accepted (Ridge 2014).\nFunction parse relies on a builtin Token datatype. User-defined token-types\nare currently not supported. parseString enables parsing character strings.\nThe user is granted GLL.Combinators.Options to specify certain disambiguation\nrules.\nGLL.Combinators.MemInterface is a memoised version of the library.\nParsers are no longer pure functions and must be built inside the IO monad,\nproviding fresh memo-tables to each memo'ed non-terminal.\nSee UnitTests and MemTests for examples of using both version of\nthe library.";
