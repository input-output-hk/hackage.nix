Currently all algorithms\nguarantee only that local minima will be found, not global\nones.\n\nAlmost any continuosly differentiable function @f : R^n -> R@\nmay be optimized by this library.  Any further restrictions\nare listed in the modules that need them.\n\nWe use the @vector@ package to represent vectors and\nmatrices, although it would be possible to use something like\n@hmatrix@ easily.\n\nCurrently only CG_DESCENT method is implemented.";
