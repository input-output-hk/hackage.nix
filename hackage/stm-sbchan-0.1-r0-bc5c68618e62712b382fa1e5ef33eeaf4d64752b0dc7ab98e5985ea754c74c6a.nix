It supports a limit on the /total size/ of items in the channel.\n\nstm-sbchan also provides a few features not found in other bounded channel\nlibraries, such as:\n\n* Alternative overflow strategies @cramSBChan@ and @rollSBChan@.\n@cramSBChan@ ignores the channel's size limit, and @rollSBChan@\nremoves old items from the beginning of the channel when it fills up.\n\n* The channel limit can be adjusted at runtime.";
