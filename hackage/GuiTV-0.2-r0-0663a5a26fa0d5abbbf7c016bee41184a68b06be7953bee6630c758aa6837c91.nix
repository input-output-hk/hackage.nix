      description = "GuiTV is a very small library that extends the TV (tangible value)\nframework with graphical user interfaces, using Phooey.  (See\n<http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/TV> and\n<http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Phooey>.)  The functionality was part of\nthe TV package up to version 0.1.1.  I moved it out to eliminate the\ndependency of core TV on Phooey and hence on wxHaskell, as the latter\ncan be difficult to install.\n\nTry out the examples in @src\\/Examples.hs@.\n\nFor more information, including examples, please see the project wiki\npage <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GuiTV>\n\nThis page and the module documentation pages have links to colorized\nsource code and to wiki pages where you can read and contribute /user\ncomments/.  Enjoy!\n\n&#169; 2007 by Conal Elliott; BSD3 license.";
