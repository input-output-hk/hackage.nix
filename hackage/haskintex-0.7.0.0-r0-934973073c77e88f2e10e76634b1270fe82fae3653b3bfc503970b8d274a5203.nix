      description = "The /haskintex/ (Haskell in LaTeX) program is a tool that reads a LaTeX file and evaluates Haskell expressions contained\nin some specific commands and environments. It allows you to define your own functions, use any GHC Haskell language\nextension and, in brief, anything you can do within Haskell.\nAdditionally, it is possible to include expressions of 'LaTeX' type (see /HaTeX/ package) and render them as LaTeX code.\nYou can freely add any Haskell code you need, and make this code appear /optionally/ in the LaTeX output. It is a tiny program,\nand therefore, easy to understand, use and predict.\n\nAdditions from last version:\n\n* /haskintex/ is now able to detect that is running on a cabal sandbox, and will use the sandbox package\ndb if this is the case. Unless the flag @-nosandbox@ is given, in which case the sandbox will be ignored.\n\n* New flag @-nosandbox@. Ignore sandbox if /haskintex/ runs on one.\n";
