It\nhas the following properties:\n\n* Nicer API than @random@. (Supports all sizes of @Int@ and\n@Word@, for example.)\n\n* Much faster than @random@. (In my tests, roughly 14x faster.)\n\n* Comparable quality to @random@. (Both libraries pass the \\\"Die\nHarder\\\" suite of statistical randomness tests. In other words,\nneither has any overly obvious pattern to the \\\"random\\\" numbers\nit produces. Both libraries pass Die Harder with similar scores.)\n\n* 100% Haskell '98 code. No compiler-specific features. No\nexternal dependencies. Builds everywhere.\n\n* Pure functions and simple ADTs. No mutable state, no @IO@ monad.\nSimple API.\n\nThe actual algorithm is a lag-4 Multiply With Carry (MWC)\ngenerator, using 32-bit arithmetic. (Should be fast on 32-bit and\n64-bit platforms.) If my algebra is correct, its period should be\nroughly 1.46 * 10^48. (By constrast, @random@ claims to have a\nperiod of only 2.30 * 10^18.)\n\nNote that this algorithm, by itself, is /not/ cryptographically\nsecure.\n\nChanges:\n\n* Initial release.";
