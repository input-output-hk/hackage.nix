      description = "Amazon ElastiCache\nAmazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up,\noperate, and scale a distributed cache in the cloud.\nWith ElastiCache, customers gain all of the benefits of a\nhigh-performance, in-memory cache with far less of the administrative\nburden of launching and managing a distributed cache. The service makes\nsetup, scaling, and cluster failure handling much simpler than in a\nself-managed cache deployment.\nIn addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get\nenhanced visibility into the key performance statistics associated with\ntheir cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.\n\nThe types from this library are intended to be used with\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides\nmechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries\nsuch as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.\n\nSee \"Network.AWS.ElastiCache\" and the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>\nto get started.";
