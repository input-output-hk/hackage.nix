      description = "notcpp is a library that attempts to provide an alternative to\nusing CPP as a mechanism for conditional compilation. It provides\nfacilities for determining if specific names or class instances\nexist and responding accordingly.\n\nWhen a value or class instance appears between minor releases of a\nthird-party package, a common way of dealing with the problem is to\nuse CPP to conditionally use one block of code or another. The\ntrouble with CPP is it's hard to statically analyse: tools based on\nhaskell-src-exts will outright refuse to parse it, for example. It\nturns out Template Haskell will do the same job in some cases.\n\nnotcpp is largely a proof-of-concept, experimental package: you\nare welcome to use it if it suits you, but it may be liable to\nchange suddenly.";
