The version constraints can\nbe specified in typical cabal fashion (e.g. >= 8.3, == 0.9.*, >= 8.3 && < 9.0).\n\nUsage: cabalvchk package-name version-constraints [verbose]\n\nNote that the version-constraints will probably need to be enclosed in\nsingle-quotes to prevent the shell from interpreting characters in the\nspecification.\n\nOne use of this utility is by external configuration/validation utilities\n(e.g. autoconf) to verify installed package versions without running a\ncabal build.  This utility produces no output (unless a third argument is\nspecified) and the return value is 0 if the constraints are met or non-zero\nif the constraints are not met (including if the package is not installed).\n\nChanges in 0.2:\n\n* Handles multiple package installations by returning 0 if any of the\ninstalled versions satisfies the constraints.\n";
