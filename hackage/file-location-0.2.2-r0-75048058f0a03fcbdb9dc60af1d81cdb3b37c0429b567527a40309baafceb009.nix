All of these behave the same as their normal counterpart but also spit out a location.\n\nI also included my favorite helper, debug, which is like trace but just show the value.\n\n> debug [1,2,3]\n>\n> DEBUG: [1,2,3]\n> [1,2,3]\n\nAnd The Template Haskell version.\n\n> \$(dbg) [1,2,3]\n>\n> DEBUG main:Main main.hs:1:3 [1,2,3]\n> [1,2,3]\n\nSee module for a listing of all the functions with short descriptions, and the homepage for some more examples https://github.com/gregwebs/ErrorLocation.hs";
