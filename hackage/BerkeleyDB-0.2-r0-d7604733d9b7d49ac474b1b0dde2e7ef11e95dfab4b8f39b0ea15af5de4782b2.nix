Databases may be organized in one of four methods:\nin a hashtable, in a b-tree, in a stream of fixed-length records,\nand in a stream of variable-length records.  Custom comparison\nand hash functions are supported.  Most of the standard database\nAPI is supported.\n\nThis implementation *seems* stable, inasmuch as I don't know of any\nglaring flaws, but I haven't done anything that could even jokingly\nbe referred to as coverage testing.";
