      description = "This package provides a higher-level interface over\nthreads, in which an @Async a@ is a concurrent\nthread that will eventually deliver a value of\ntype @a@.  The package provides ways to create\n@Async@ computations, wait for their results, and\ncancel them.\n\nUsing @Async@ is safer than using threads in two\nways:\n\n* When waiting for a thread to return a result,\nif the thread dies with an exception then the\ncaller must either re-throw the exception\n('wait') or handle it ('waitCatch'); the\nexception cannot be ignored.\n\n* The API makes it possible to build a tree of\nthreads that are automatically killed when\ntheir parent dies (see 'withAsync').";
