Implementation is based on\n<http://unlines.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/generics-for-small-fixed-size-vectors/>\nSame functions could be used to work with both ADT based vector like\n\n> data Vec3 a = a a a\n\nTuples are vectors too:\n\n>>> sum (1,2,3)\n6\n\nVectors which are represented internally by arrays are provided by\nlibrary. Both boxed and unboxed arrays are supported.\n\nLibrary is structured as follows:\n\n[@Data.Vector.Fixed@]\nGeneric API. It's suitable for both ADT-based vector like @Complex@\nand array-based ones.\n\n[@Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont@]\nContinuation based vectors. Internally all functions use them.\n\n[@Data.Vector.Fixed.Mutable@]\nType classes for array-based implementation and API for working with\nmutable state.\n\n[@Data.Vector.Fixed.Unboxed@]\nUnboxed vectors.\n\n[@Data.Vector.Fixed.Boxed@]\nBoxed vector which can hold elements of any type.\n\n[@Data.Vector.Fixed.Storable@]\nUnboxed vectors of @Storable@  types.\n\n[@Data.Vector.Fixed.Primitive@]\nUnboxed vectors based on pritimive package.\n\n[@Data.Vector.Fixed.Monomorphic@]\nWrappers for monomorphic vectors\n\nChanges in 0.4.2.0\n\n* 1-tuple @Only@ added.\n\n* @fromList'@ and @fromListM@ added.\n\n* @apply@ functions from @Arity@ type class generalized.\n\nChanges in 0.4.1.0\n\n* @cons@ function added.\n\n* Getter to @Fun@ data type added.\n\nChanges in 0.4.0.0\n\n* Wrapper for monomorphics vectors is added.\n\n* @VecList@ is reimplemented as GADT and constructors are exported.\n\n* Constructor of ContVecT is exported\n\n* Empty @ContVecT@ is implemented as @empty@.\n\n* @Typeable@, @Foldable@ and @Traversable@ instances are added where\nappropriate\n\nChanges in 0.3.0.0\n\n* Wrappers for monomorphic types added.\n\nChanges in 0.3.0.0\n\n* @Vector@ type class definition is moved to the @D.V.F.Cont@ module.\n\n* Indexing function restored.\n\n* @unfoldr@ added.\n\nChanges in 0.2.0.0\n\n* Continuation-based vector added.\n\n* Right fold added.\n\n* @tailWith@, @convertContinuation@, and @!@ from\n@Data.Vector.Fixed@ removed.\n\n* @Vector@ instance for tuples added.\n\nChanges in 0.1.2\n\n* @imap@, @imapM@, @ifoldl@, @ifoldM@, @zipWithM@, @izipWithM@\nfunctions are added.\n\n* @VectorN@ type class added.\n\nChanges in 0.1.1\n\n* @foldM@ and @tailWith@ added.
