      description = "This library implements the ideas of /Data types a la carte/\n(Journal of Functional Programming, 18(4):423-436, 2008,\n<http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0956796808006758>) as outlined in the\npaper /Compositional data types/ (Workshop on Generic Programming,\n83-94, 2011, <http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2036918.2036930>). The\npurpose of this library is to allow the programmer to construct data\ntypes -- as well as the functions defined on them -- in a modular\nfashion. The underlying idea is to separate the signature of a data\ntype from the fixed point construction that produces its recursive\nstructure. Signatures can then be composed and decomposed freely.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, this library provides additional\nextensions and (run-time) optimisations which make compositional data types\nusable for practical implementations. In particular, it\nprovides an excellent framework for manipulating and analysing\nabstract syntax trees in a type-safe manner. Thus, it is perfectly\nsuited for programming language implementations, especially, in an environment\nconsisting of a family of tightly interwoven /domain-specific languages/.\n\nIn concrete terms, this library provides the following features:\n\n*  Compositional data types in the style of Wouter Swierstra's\nFunctional Pearl /Data types a la carte/. The implementation of\nsignature subsumption is based on the paper\n/Composing and Decomposing Data Types/ (Workshop on Generic\nProgramming, 2014, to appear), which makes signature composition more\nflexible.\n\n*  Modular definition of functions on compositional data types through\ncatamorphisms and anamorphisms as well as more structured\nrecursion schemes such as primitive recursion  and co-recursion,\nand course-of-value iteration and co-iteration.\n\n*  Support for monadic computations via monadic variants of all\nrecursion schemes.\n\n*  Support of a succinct programming style over compositional data types\nvia generic programming combinators that allow various forms of\ngeneric transformations and generic queries.\n\n*  Generalisation of compositional data types (terms) to\ncompositional data types \\\"with holes\\\" (contexts). This allows\nflexible reuse of a wide variety of catamorphisms (called\n/term homomorphisms/) as well as an efficient composition of them.\n\n*  Operations on signatures, for example, to add and remove\nannotations of abstract syntax trees. This includes combinators to\npropagate annotations fully automatically through certain\nterm homomorphisms.\n\n*  Optimisation of the implementation of recursion schemes. This\nincludes /short-cut fusion/ style optimisation rules which yield a\nperformance boost of up to factor six.\n\n*  Automatic derivation of instances of all relevant type classes for\nusing compositional data types via /Template Haskell/. This includes\ninstances of 'Prelude.Eq', 'Prelude.Ord' and 'Prelude.Show' that are\nderived via instances for functorial variants of them. Additionally,\nalso /smart constructors/, which allow to easily construct inhabitants\nof compositional data types, are automatically generated.\n\n*  /Mutually recursive data types/ and\n/generalised algebraic data types (GADTs)/. All of the above is also lifted\nto families of mutually recursive data types and (more generally) GADTs.\nThis extension resides in the module \"Data.Comp.Multi\".\n\n* Advanced recursion schemes derived from tree automata. These\nrecursion schemes allow for a higher degree of modularity and make\nit possible to apply fusion. See /Modular Tree Automata/\n(Mathematics of Program Construction, 263-299, 2012,\n<http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31113-0_14>) and\n/Programming Macro Tree Transducers/ (Workshop on Generic Programming, 61-72,\n2013, <http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2502488.2502489>).\n\nExamples of using (generalised) compositional data types are bundled\nwith the package in the folder @examples@.\n\nPrevious versions of this library contained a parametric variant of\ncompositional data types. This former part of the library has been\nmoved to a separate package: @compdata-param@\n<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/compdata-param>";
