It lets you\nrun full-text queries on a collection of your documents.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Can search over any type of \\\"document\\\".\n(You explain how to extract search terms from them.)\n\n* Supports documents with multiple fields\n(e.g. title, body)\n\n* Supports documents with non-term features\n(e.g. quality score, page rank)\n\n* Uses the state of the art BM25F ranking function\n\n* Adjustable ranking parameters (including field weights\nand non-term feature scores)\n\n* In-memory but quite compact. It does not keep a copy of\nyour original documents.\n\nIt is independent of the document type, so you have to\nwrite the document-specific parts: extracting search terms\nand any case-normalisation or stemming. This is quite\neasy using libraries such as\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tokenize tokenize> and\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/snowball snowball>.\n\nFor an example, see the code for the\n<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hackage-server hackage-server>\nwhere it is used for the package search feature.";
