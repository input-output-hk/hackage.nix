      description = "This library provides an infrastructure to build command line programs. It provides the following features:\n\n- declare any number of \\\"actions\\\" (commands, or modes of operation, of the program);\n\n- declare options of the program;\n\n- collect options and actions from a configuration file and the command line, and execute the proper action.\n\n\nIt provides functionality similar to the \\\"cmdargs\\\" package. Main differences:\n\n- console-program does not use unsafePerformIO, and tries to give a more haskellish, referentially transparent interface;\n\n- it allows a full tree of \\\"modes\\\", instead of a list, so a command can have subcommands;\n\n- it parses a configuration file, in addition to the command line arguments.";
