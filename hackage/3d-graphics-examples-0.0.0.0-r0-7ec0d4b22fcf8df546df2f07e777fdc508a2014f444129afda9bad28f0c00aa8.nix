It contains two programs, which are both\nabout fractals:\n\n[L-systems] generates graphics from Lindenmayer systems\n(L-systems). It defines a language for L-systems as an embedded\nDSL.\n\n[Mountains] uses the generalized Brownian motion to generate\ngraphics that resemble mountain landscapes.\n\nThe original versions of these programs were written by Matthias\nReisner as part of a student project at the Brandenburg\nUniversity of Technology at Cottbus, Germany. Wolfgang Jeltsch,\nwho supervised this student project, is now maintaining these\nprograms.";
