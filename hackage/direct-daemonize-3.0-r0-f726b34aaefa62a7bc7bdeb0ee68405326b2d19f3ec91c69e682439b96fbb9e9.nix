It does not function\non other systems.\nVersion 3.0 cleans up the parameters structure.\nVersion 2.0 fixes compatibility problems with the threaded GHC runtime.\nDoing this required two non-backwards-compatible API changes.  First, the daemonize function now takes an action to perform as a daemon, and never\nreturns.  Second, the functionality of closing all open files has been\nremoved, as it caused crashes.  As a substitute, the option of closing only\nthe three standard streams has been added and made the default.";
