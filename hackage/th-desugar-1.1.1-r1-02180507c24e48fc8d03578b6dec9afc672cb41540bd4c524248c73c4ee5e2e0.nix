The intended use\nof this package is as a preprocessor for more advanced code manipulation\ntools. Note that the input to any of the ds... functions should be produced\nfrom a TH quote, using the syntax [| ... |]. If the input to these functions\nis a hand-coded TH syntax tree, the results may be unpredictable. In\nparticular, it is likely that promoted datatypes will not work as expected.";
