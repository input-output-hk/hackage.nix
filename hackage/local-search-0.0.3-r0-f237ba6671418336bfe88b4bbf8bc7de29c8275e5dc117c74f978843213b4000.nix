It is based on work presented to\nIFL2010, a draft of which is currently available on the homepage. The library\nmodels local search space using a rose tree, with child nodes forming the\nneighbourhood of any solution. The tree can then be transformed by various\ncombinators to implement different searching strategies; the result is then\n\"navigated\" to yield a sequence of solutions.";
