The\nlanguage provides a uniform way to define shaders and compositor\nchains by treating both streams and framebuffers as first-class\nvalues.\n\nAs a user of the library you only need to import the \"LambdaCube.GL\" and\n\"LambdaCube.GL.Mesh\" modules. You should check out the pointers at <http://lambdacube3d.wordpress.com/getting-started/>\nto understand the principle behind the library, and also have a good look\nat the @lambdacube-samples@ package.";
