      description = "Can you write a list in Haskell? Then you can write embedded C code using\nCopilot. Here's a Copilot program that computes the Fibonacci sequence (over\nWord 64s) and tests for even numbers:\n\n> fib :: Streams\n> fib = do\n>  let f = varW64 \"fib\"\n>  let t = varB \"t\"\n>  f .= [0,1] ++ f + (drop 1 f)\n>  t .= even f\n>    where even :: Spec Word64 -> Spec Bool\n>          even w' = w' `mod` 2 == 0\n\nCopilot contains an interpreter, a compiler, and uses a model-checker to check\nthe correctness of your program. The compiler generates constant time and\nconstant space C code via Tom Hawkin's Atom (thanks Tom!). Copilot was\noriginally developed to write embedded monitors for more complex embedded\nsystems, but it can be used to develop a variety of functional-style embedded\ncode.";
