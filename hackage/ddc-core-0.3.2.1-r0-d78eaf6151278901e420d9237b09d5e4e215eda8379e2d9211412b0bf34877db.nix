In addition to the polymorphism of\nSystem-F2 it supports region, effect and closure typing. Evaluation order is\nleft-to-right call-by-value by default. There is a capability system to track whether\nobjects are mutable or constant, and to ensure that computations that perform visible\nside effects are not reordered inappropriately.\nSee the @ddc-tools@ package for a user-facing interpreter and compiler.";
