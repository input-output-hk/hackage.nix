It was abstracted from following (commonly used)\npattern @f . h . g@ where @f@ and @g@ are fixed.\n\nThis library not only define @~\\@~@ combinator, but also some derived\ncombinators that can help us to easily define a lot of things including\nlenses. See <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens package> for\ndetais on what lenses are.\n\nFunction @Data.Function.on@ can be implemented using @~\\@~@ as:\n\n> on :: (b -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> a -> c\n> on f g = (id ~@~ g ~@~ g) f\n\nIf function @on3@ existed in /base/ then it could be defined as:\n\n> on3 :: (b -> b -> b -> d) -> (a -> b) -> a -> a -> a -> d\n> on3 f g = (id ~@~ g ~@~ g ~@~ g) f\n\nOther usage examples and documentation can be found in\n\"Data.Function.Between\" module.";
