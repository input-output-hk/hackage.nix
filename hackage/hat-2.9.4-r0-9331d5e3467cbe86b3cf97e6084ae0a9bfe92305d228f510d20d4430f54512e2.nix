Module imports and exports have\nalso been improved to handle nearly all kinds of renaming, hiding, etc.\nHat 2.9 works only with ghc for Haskell 98 (plus a few extensions) and\nthe standard Haskell 98 libraries plus some Haskell 2010 libraries.\nAlthough it should build on any operating system,\nmost viewing tools use ASCII console escape sequences and they open xterms;\nhence they will only work well under Unix and X11.\nTested on MacOS X 10.11.6.\nInstallation:\n> cabal -v install\nFlag -v allows you to see what is going on. Building takes a long time\n(one module has 25.000 lines of code).\nSome compiler warnings have been turned off. The tracing transformation does produce\ncode with lots of overlapping patterns.\nUse:\n> hat-make MyProgram.hs\ntransforms and compiles all modules of your program and produces the tracing\nversion Hat/MyProgram.\nRun your program\n> Hat/MyProgram\nwhich will produce trace files MyProgram.hat*\nUse the viewing tools to explore the trace:\n> hat-trail / hat-observe / hat-explore /...   MyProgram\nThere is documentation in the \"docs\" folder, but it is partially outdated.\nThere are a few small programs for exploring tracing in the \"examples\" folder.";
