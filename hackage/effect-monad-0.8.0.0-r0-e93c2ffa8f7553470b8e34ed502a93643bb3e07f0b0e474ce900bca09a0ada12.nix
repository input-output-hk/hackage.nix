This provides a way\nto embed effect systems into Haskell. For more information see the paper\n\\\"Embedding effect systems in Haskell\\\" by Orchard and Petricek\n<http://dorchard.co.uk/publ/haskell14-effects.pdf> (Haskell, 2014)\nAlso provides the parameterised monad structure due to Atkey in\nControl.Effect.Parameterised along with some instances:\nAtomicState, SafeFiles, ExtensibleState\nand the examples in <https://github.com/dorchard/effect-monad/tree/master/examples>.\n(note, this package was previously called 'ixmonad' until September 2014).";
