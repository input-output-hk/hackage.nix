It is used currently as a helper package\nfor @curlhs@ (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/curlhs>), but is not\nready for the public use (more tests and design decisions needed).\n\nPackage is distributed under ISC License (MIT/BSD-style, see LICENSE file\nfor details). It is marked as @OtherLicense@ due to limitations of Cabal.\n\n<<https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-53767359-1/hackage/rtld>>";
