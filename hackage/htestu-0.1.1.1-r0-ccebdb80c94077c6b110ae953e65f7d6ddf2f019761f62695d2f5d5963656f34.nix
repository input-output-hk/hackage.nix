L'Ecuyer and R. Simard.\nBasically HTestU performs a wrapping of a member of the RandomGen typeclass (any reasonable PRNG can be made a member of it) and\nfeeds a wrapped generator into a C library which calls the wrapped generator to fill the buffer with pseudo random numbers and then\nperform tests on the generated numbers.\nHTestU offers three batteries: smallCrush, crush and bigCrush (as they were specified in TestU01 paper) and a number of\nstreaming functions which allow one to wrap the PRNG differently for the purpose of testing different patterns of PRNG usage.";
