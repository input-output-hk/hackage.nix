For example, as a\npresenter, it is useful to see the next slide before it is shown to\nthe audience as well as how much allotted time remains.\n\nThere are a lot of features that may not be immediately obvious so\nplease be sure to look at the documentation.\nFor help with the command line, use the \"--help\" flag.\nFor help with the GUI, press the \"?\" key when the program is running.\nThe \"README\" contains a terse summary of all the features.\n\nFor more information and example uses, please visit the project home page.";
