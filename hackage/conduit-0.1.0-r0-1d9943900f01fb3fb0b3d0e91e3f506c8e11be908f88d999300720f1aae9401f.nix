For more information, see <http://www.yesodweb.com/book/conduit>.\n\nRelease history:\n\n* 0.1: @BufferedSource@ is now an abstract type, and has a much more efficient internal representation. The result was a 41% speedup on microbenchmarks (note: do not expect speedups anywhere near that in real usage). In general, we are moving towards @BufferedSource@ being a specific tool used internally as needed, but using @Source@ for all external APIs.\n\n* 0.0: Initial release.";
