We have good generators\nthemselves (for example, the mersenne-random-pure64 package), however, users\nare often tempted to store the generator in a lazy state monad. This\ncauses performance problems.\n\nThis package provides an optimized 'Rand' monad for monadic generation\nof random numbers from a state, with close attention to performance. You\nmay have results an order of magnitude or more better than using\nControl.Monad.State to store your generator.";
