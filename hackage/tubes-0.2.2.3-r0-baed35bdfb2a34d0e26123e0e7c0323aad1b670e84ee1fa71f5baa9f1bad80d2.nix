A computation of type\n@Tube a b m r@ consumes values of type 'a' and produces values of type\n'b'.\n\n@Tube@s are coroutines which can suspend computation to yield an\nintermediate value or continue execution by requesting an upstream value.\n\nExamples and more information may be found at\n<https://github.com/gatlin/tubes>.\n\nIf I managed to upload another faulty package that does not build\ncorrectly, Hackage documentation is also available at\n<http://niltag.net/tubes>. This should compile on GHC 7.8, but the problem\nis that previous attempts at setting the versions properly rendered Hackage\nunable to generate documentation. Hopefully I have this fixed but any\nadvice is welcome.";
