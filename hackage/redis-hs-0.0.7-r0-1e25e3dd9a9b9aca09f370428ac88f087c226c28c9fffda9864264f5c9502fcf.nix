It is a developer pre-\nrelease, and so lacks many of the features of the existing `redis` package\n(like a monad wrapper, state management, and custom concurrency management)\nbut for light use, this library makes using Redis very straightforward.\n\nThe feature set is incomplete, and version 1.0.0 will be tagged only when the\nlibrary has full command coverage, reasonable test coverage, and solid\ndocumentation.\n\nThe source code is available on GitHub <http://github.com/wlangstroth/redis-hs>.";
