This is a mirror of the CUDD source that has been modified to build shared object files.\n\nIf you chose the latter option you need to tell cabal where to find cudd:\n\n\"cabal install cudd --extra-include-dirs=\\/path\\/to\\/cudd\\/src\\/include --extra-lib-dirs=\\/path\\/to\\/cudd\\/src\\/libso\"\n\nand you need to tell your program where to find the shared libraries:\n\n\"LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\\/path\\/to\\/cudd\\/src\\/libso ghci\"\n\n/Usage/\n\nThis package provides two interfaces to the CUDD library:\n\n* A purely functional one in \"Cudd.Cudd\" that automatically dereferences BDDs during garbage collection.\n\n* An ST Monad based one in \"Cudd.Imperative\" that gives you precise control over the ordering of BDD operations and when BDDs are dereferenced. Use this one if you want your code to perform well.";
